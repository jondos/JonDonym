<H2>Supported programs </H2>
<p>JonDo currenty only supports the following internet protocols:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTTP</li>
  <li>HTTPS</li>
  <li>FTP (download only)</li>
  <li>Gopher</li>
</ul>
<p>These are typical programs supported by JonDo:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="browser.html">Webbrowsers</a></li>
  <li>Download-Managers (insert JonDo as HTTP proxy <a href="browser.html">like in web browsers</a>) </li>
</ul>
<p>JonDo is mainly designed for anonymous web browsing. Therefore, the following applications are <strong>not supported</strong> by JonDo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Filesharing, Peer-To-Peer (Emule, BitTorrent, BitComet,...) </li>
  <li>Chat, Instant Messaging (ICQ, AIM, Yahoo Messenger,...) </li>
  <li>E-Mail</li>
  <li>Internet telephony (VoIP, Skype,...)</li>
  <li>FTP, Telnet, SSH,... </li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, you find hints on the net that explain how to anonymise the mentioned applications with JonDo. They are kind of alchemy and do not work really. Some of these connections, like Skype, may be run over JonDo theoretically, but this does not anonymise them, only the traffic is forwarded. The Skype operator himself can deanonymise each of the communication connections with ease, despite the Mixes in the middle.</p>
<p>Moreover, script based (JavaScript/Java/Flash) web applications<strong> cannot</strong> be anonymized, like Chatrooms, interactive maps and online games. Scripts can circumvent JonDo's security mechanisms more or less easy. Whoever wants to be anonymous should not use web applications of this kind.
