<H2>CookieCuller</H2>
This  Firefox plugin enables you to select (protect) wanted cookies and delete the rest. Deletion can be done manually or automatically during startup of Firefox. This means, that cookies will be accepted (which might be important for proper functioning) but deleted later if you didn't mark them as worth having. So "bad" sites will no longer be able to recognize you which means that they cannot generate a profile of you.
