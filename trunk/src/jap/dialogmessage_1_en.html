<h3>Please help us to improve the security of AN.ON/JonDonym</h3>
Dear user, we need your help for a study about possible risks for the anonymity of users of AN.ON/JonDonym. Our Goal is to improve the security of our service. 
Therefore we would like to evaluate how often the same user connects to our service until 20th of July 2008.<br>
<br>
If you agree to participate, then a random number will be generated once 
and this number will be transmitted to the anonymity service every time you connect.
You can withdraw your agreement at any time. Click on "Study" in the configuration dialog and choose “Withdraw” in order to do so.<br>
<br>
<b>No additional personal information will be transmitted. You remain anonymous. </b><br>
<br>
We would appreciate very much your assistance in improving the security of our anonymity service.<br>
If you do not take part in our study you can use AN.ON/JonDonym as before.
Do not hesitate to contact study@anon.inf.tu-dresden.de for any further questions and comments.
You may also consult the online help for more information.<br>
