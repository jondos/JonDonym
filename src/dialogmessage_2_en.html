<h3>Improvements to the security of AN.ON/JonDonym</h3>
Dear JAP/JonDo user, we need your help in order to improve the security of our anonymity service. 
To that we need to evaluate how often the same user connects to our service.<br>
<br>
If you agree to participate until July 20th 2008, then a random number will be generated 
and this number will be transmitted to the anonymity service every time you connect.
You can withdraw your agreement at any time.<br>
<br>
<b>Of course, your anonymity will be preserved at all times. No personal information will be transmitted.</b><br>
<br>
We would appreciate very much your assistance in improving the security of our anonymity service.<br>
Do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:study@anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">study@anon.inf.tu-dresden.de</a> for any further questions and comments.
You may also consult the online help for more information.<br>

Your JAP-Team
