<h2>Services: Advanced Settings</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">This panel is only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert View.</a> To get to this settings
panel, click <code class="jconf">Settings</code> in the main window of JonDo,
choose the entry <codeclass="jconf">Services from the list on the left, and
open the tab <code class="jconf">Advanced Settings</code>. </em> </p>

<p>The following general settings concerning all services can be made from
here: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b><a name="headerfilter">Anonymize HTTP header</a></b><br>
    If this option has been activated, the HTTP header sent by the browser
    will be set to default values which equal those of <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. This renders users of other browsers
    less distinguishable from JonDoFox users or those that have also enabled
    HTTP filtering. This can improve the protection of privacy but is not
    necessary if using <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    This function is only available for unencrypted connections to websites
    (HTTP). A respective filtering for encrypted connections (HTTPS) can only
    be done by <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Confirm every website individually if anonymous mode is
    off</b><br>
    With this box checked and anonymity mode switched off, JonDo will demand
    your individual confirmation in order to prevent pages from being loaded
    unnoticeably without protection whenever requesting a website domain. If
    you uncheck this box, JonDo will allow a direct connection to the web
    server in non-anonymous mode without asking for individual confirmation,
    but only ask for your confirmation once.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Activate anonymity service immediately after program start</b><br>
    If this box is checked, JonDo automatically connects to the anonymization
    service when started. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Auto reconnect after connection was lost</b><br>
    Check this box if you want JonDo to automatically reconnect to the
    anonymization service if the connection has been lost. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Automatically switch services</b><br>
    This option randomly selects a service from the cascades set in your <a
    href="services_anon.html#filter">service filter</a> if the active service
    fails or is unreachable. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>When starting JAP/JonDo also</b><br>
    With this option deactivated JonDo will connect to the same service it
    has been connected to before it was last shutdown. Otherwise, a random
    service will be selected based on the <a
    href="services_anon.html#filter">filter criteria</a> you have set.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Connect to explicitly allowed services only (Whitelist)</b><br>
    If activated, JonDo will only allow connections to services that you have
    explicitly verified and allowed before. This ensures optimal protection
    from unwillingly connecting to untrusted JonDonym services. On the other
    hand, you will not benefit automatically from new available services, but
    will have to unlock them one by one in the <a
    href="services_anon.html">JonDonym service panel</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Send keep-alive packets</b><br>
    Here you can decide how often zero-content dummy packets should be sent
    in order to keep the connection alive when no other packets are currently
    sent by you.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Login timeout</b><br>
    If your Internet connection is slow, a timeout too short for the login to
    services may prevent JonDo from establishing an anonymous connection. A
    timeout too high may cause long waiting times when connecting if the
    currently chosen service is not available or the connection is blocking
    for other reasons. Therefore increase or lower the timeout just as you
    need it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
