<H2>Debugging</H2>
<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i><P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Debugging</i> from the list to the left.<br>
Here you can configure how many status and error messages appear at the console while running JonDo (for example a DOS window console).  If you're having problems with JonDo, you might be able to localize them using these error messages.  If you're unable to find the solution and request help from us, you should definitely attach the appropriate error messages to your e-mail.
<br>In that case, please attach your <A HREF="japconf.html">JonDo configuration file</A> also.

<P>
<b>Show messages belonging to the following subsystems</b><br>
By setting the checkboxes for the appropriate topics, you can choose whether you want to receive messages concerning that topic.
<P>
<b>Show messages of the following level</b><br>
With the sliding bar, you can choose the level of importance a message must have in order to be shown on the console.  If it's at the very bottom, only messages that concern severe problems that prevent correct functioning of the service will be shown.
<P>
<b>Detail level of log messages</b><br>
The higher the level, the more detailed log messages will become.
<P>
Please read the <A HREF="trouble.html">troubleshooting</A> page as well.

<P>
<b>Show messages in a separate window</b><br>
If this box is checked, a separate window will appear for debug messages. Within this window, you can copy or save the messages and send them to us by e-mail.
<P>
<b>Write messages to the following file</b><br>
If this box is checked, you can indicate a file in which the debug messages are to be saved.
