<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>

<b>Neither <a href="index.html">this help</a> nor JonDo's built-in assistant (a button in the main window) were able to solve my problem</b>
<P>First of all, read the <A href="http://www.jondos.de/de/faq">FAQ on our homepage</A>.
<P><B>I did not find the answer to my question in the FAQ </B>
<P>If you did not find the answer to your problem in the FAQ, you have several possibilities to ask others. But be sure to <strong>provide everything</strong> of the following information, as otherwise you will get no or an unsatisfying answer:</P>
<UL>
  <LI> A detailed description of the error and the situation(s) in which it occurs. It will take much longer to solve the problem if you just tell us <i>it does not work</i>.
  <LI>The version of JonDo your are using (appears in the start-up screen and when you click on &quot;i&quot; in the JonDo main window).  
  <LI>Your installed Java version(s). </li>
 </ul>

In many cases, also this information here may be important:
 
 <ul>
  <LI>Name and version of your browser and operating system, ideally information about installed service packs, too.
  <LI>Do you have a desktop firewall? If yes, which one?
  <LI>Do you have an anti virus tool? If yes, which one?
  <LI> A description of your internet connection (your provider, whether you connect via local network, external firewall or forced proxy).    
</UL>
If you are able to provide them, also the following information may also be useful in solving your problem:
<ul>
	<li>Your transaction number, if you did create an account, or the number of your pseudonymous account. 
		  Otherwise it may not be possible to solve problems concerning payment.</li>
	<LI>The version of your japdll.dll (appears when you click on &quot;i&quot; in the JonDo main window). </li>
  <LI>The <a href="appearance.html">Look&amp;Feel</a> setting of JonDo.   </li>
  <LI> On demand: A copy of the <A HREF="debugging.html">error messages</A> displayed on the console. To get the appropriate error messages, you have to activate all checks concerning debugging in the <em>config</em> area under <em>Debugging</em> and set all the sliders to the top.  
</ul>
