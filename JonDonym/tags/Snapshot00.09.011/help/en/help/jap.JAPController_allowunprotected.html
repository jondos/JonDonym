<H2>Surfing without anonymity mode</H2>

JonDo prevents you from unintentionally surfing without being connected to
any anonymiser service. Although, you have the possibility to allow this
explicitly.
<P>
By default, JonDo will ask you again for a choice after a few seconds. If you
choose to remember your answer, it will be saved and JonDo won't ask you again.
If you have decided to allow non-anonymous surfing, JonDo will never remember your
answer permanently, as this would be a potential security risk four you.
Your answer is only remembered until you reconnect to any anonymity service
or you restart JonDo.
</P>
