<H2>Services:General</H2>
<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i><P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Services</i> from the list to the left, then open the tab <i>General</i><br>.

	<LI><B>Assignment of internet services to anonymizer services</B><BR>
	This overview shows which internet service is assigned to which anonymizer service. Future releases of JonDo will allow you to set your own assignments. Meanwhile, this is merely for your information.
	<P>
    <LI><B>Deny all data traffic without call back if anonymous mode is switched off</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JonDo will not transfer non-anonymous traffic. Your browser will show a hint which says that browsing the web is currently not possible.
    <br>If you do NOT check this box, JonDo will show a warning window which has the option to allow non-anonymous browsing for a short amount of time.

    <P>
	<LI><B>Connect to explicitly unlocked cascades only  (Whitelist)</B><br>
    If activated, JonDo will only allow connections to cascades that you have explicitly checked and unlocked before. This optimally protects you from connecting to untrusted JonDonym services. On the other hand, you will not automatically benefit from new available services, but will have to unlock them one by one in the <a href="services_anon.html">JonDonym service view</a>.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto connect after program start</B><BR>
    If this box is checked, JonDo automatically connects to the anonymization service when JonDo is started.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Auto re-connect after connection to mix was lost</B><BR>
    Check this box if you want JonDo to automatically reconnect to the anonymization service if the connection is lost.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Automatically change Mix cascades</B><BR>
    With this option activated, JonDo will choose a cascade by chance<!-- according to your <a href="jap.JAPConfTrust.html">trust settings</a>-->. During anonymous browsing, however, cascades will only be switched if the active cascade is offline.
      <P>
  <LI><B>Send dummy packet</B><BR>
    Here you can decide if fake packets without any content should be sent and if so, how often.  This simulates continuous communication for any potential observers.
      <P>
    <LI><B>Login timeout</B><br>
  If your internet connection is too slow, a too short timeout for the login to services may lead prevent JonDo from establishing an anonymous connection. A too high timeout may cause long waiting times when connecting if the currently chosen service is slow or not available. Therefore set the timeout lower or higher as you need.
