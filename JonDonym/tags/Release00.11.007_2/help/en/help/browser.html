<h2>Alternative browser configuration</h2>

<p>For an optimal usage of <b>JonDo</b> we recommend also using <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. This will save you the configuration effort,
since <b>JonDoFox</b> already contains all necessary settings to surf
anonymously with <b>JonDo</b> on the Web. Further information about
<b>JonDoFox</b> may be found <a href="jondofox.html">here </a> or on the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/jondofox">JonDoFox homepage</a>. If you prefer
to use JonDonym with another browser it is necessary that you make the basic
settings yourself.</p>

<p><b>Please beware</b><br>
False or incomplete configuration causes browsers to leave a lot of traces
while surfing, even if you use JonDonym. Configuring the browser yourself is
quite elaborate and requires a deeper understanding of web technologies.</p>

<p><b>Browser updates</b></p>

<p>For surfing the web, use really up-to-date browsers only. Otherwise,
websites might attack and damage your computer directly over browser security
holes if you have activated JavaScript for the respective site. Therefore you
should regularly update your browser. Browser versions known to be insecure and
not to be further developed are, for example, <span
style="color:#ff0000">Internet Explorer 6</span>, <span
style="color:#ff0000">Mozilla Firefox 2.x</span>, <span
style="color:#ff0000">Opera 8.x</span>, <span style="color:#ff0000">Safari
2.x</span> and earlier versions of these browsers. <span
style="color:#ff0000">In no case should you use one of these browser
versions.</span> If you operating system does not support newer browsers, you
should replace it by a new one, either.</p>

<h3>Proxy settings</h3>

<p>With proxy settings you configure your browser to not send requests directly
over the Internet but through JonDo instead. This anonymizes the data. You will
need to enter the following in the proxy settings for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and if
required GOPHER proxies of your browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hostname/IP address: <i><b>127.0.0.1</b></i></li>
  <li>Port: <i><b>4001</b></i> (<b>Attention</b>: If you have setup a different
    <a href="net.html">listen port</a> than <i>4001</i> in JonDo you need to
    input it here instead of <i>4001</i> too.)</li>
</ul>

<p><!--<br>Please remember that such exceptions can be made more flexibly in a filter-proxy 
like <a href="noactive_proxomitron.html">Proxomitron.</a><BR><BR>
<BR>-->
For some browsers there are step-by-step tutorials available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="browser_ie.html">Internet Explorer</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_firefox2.html">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_opera.html">Opera</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_konqueror.html">Konqueror</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_safari.html">Safari</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, please check your browser settings with the <a
href="security_test.html">browser security test</a>.</p>

<h3>Avoiding data traces</h3>

<p>Websites can offer special (active) content that can reveal your identity or
even damage your PC, although you seem to be surfing anonymously with JonDo.
This can happen by JavaScript, Java, Flash, Silverlight and Active Scripting.
Basically, every type of dynamic webcontent that is run on the PC of the web
surfer is potentially dangerous. Most browsers offer the possibility of
blocking such content but are usually quite inflexible at it, so that the type
of content can either be flatly denied or flatly allowed. This is problematic
though since some web applications will then only be usable again after editing
the configuration: e.g. chat rooms, Flash menus and animations, or online
games. At the same time, these changes will also compromise security when
surfing on other websites that do not require active content at all. Depending
on the browser in use, it may be very complicated to completely deactivate
active content in the configuration. Most of the time, this will only be
possible to experienced computer users. Therefore, user-friendly and flexible
settings, just as in <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>, are a great
convenience. </p>

<p>Moreover, the browser sends so-called HTTP headers. They aid communication
with the web server in loading pages or using web services. But they can also
be used to identify you or create a profile of what your doing on the Net. From
the HTTP header the browser type may be obtained, furthermore the language or
the so-called <i>referer</i> which gives away your last visited page. Also, the
data contained in <a href="wwwprivacy.html#cookies">cookies</a> is being send
by HTTP headers. Although JonDo filters these HTTP headers, for technical
reasons it does so only for unencrypted websites. If an eavesdropper should
forward you to a presumably secure HTTPS site you will again be left without
filter protection. The options for adapting HTTP headers are unfortunately very
limited in most browsers. For these reasons, we recommend relying on <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> since critical HTTP headers have been
preconfigured for maximum anonymity in it.</p>

<p>Much of the information your browser gives away can be reviewed in the <a
href="security_test.html">browser security test</a>.</p>
