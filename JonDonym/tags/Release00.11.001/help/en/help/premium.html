<h2><a name="premium" id="premium">Premium services</a></h2>

<p>With JonDonym you can choose between free services and the chargeable
premium services. For premium services, you need a billing account with costs.
<b>The revenues achived thereby are used for extension and maintenance of the
JonDonym system and for improving the JonDo software</b>. Using premium
services offers a lot of additional advantages to the basic features of
JonDo:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Guaranteed access</b>: A connection to at least one of the premium
    services is guaranteed for a minimum of 90% of the annual average.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed performance:</b> Within the framework of the above
    guaranteed access, at least one service with a speed of at least 100 kbit/s
    and latencies of 4 seconds maximum will be available during 90% of the
    daily average (Free services, also Tor, are usually much slower).</li>
  <li><b>Legal certainty:</b> Development, support and billing addresses are
    all located in Germany and not at some anonymous offshore company without a
    summonable address. Germany sets worldwide standards in customer
  protection.</li>
  <li><b>Three-Operator-Guarantee:</b> The mixes of each premium cascade are
    independently run by three different organizations or individuals.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed internationality:</b> Mixes and operators of a premium
    cascade are spread over at least two countries. This ensures that no large
    network node (CIX) can monitor all data traffic. Besides, it cripples every
    national data retention since a situation where all mixes in a cascade do
    log never occurs.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed connection:</b> The mix operators generally do not block
    any Internet ports (except email ports, if needed for spam defense).</li>
</ul>

<p>Excluded from these guarantees are software errors that are discharged from
liability in the <a href="credits.html">licence</a> and <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/de/termsAndConditions">General Terms and
Conditions</a> of the software maintainers. Further possible exclusions
concerning the performance of a single service may be found in the GTCTs of the
respective mix operators.</p>

<p>If you would like to use premium services, create a <a
href="payment.html">disposable account</a> and activate it by an anonymous or
non anonymous <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">payment of your
choice</a>. After that you will have a certain amount of data volume at your
disposal, <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">depending on your chosen
rate,</a> to pay for premium services. Once it is depleted and you would like
to use the JonDonym services any further, you can create and activate another
disposable account any time.</p>

<p>Advice on protection of personal information: for accurate clearing of data
volumes with the mix operators it is saved how much volume an account has used
cumulatively on a mix cascade. Moreover, a statistical evaluation of the data
volume transferred per account is done with daily accuracy. An allocation of
accounts to user identities is not saved. It is technically impossible to
recognize requested websites by the deducted data volumes alone, even when
monitoring accurately to the second or at maximum accuracy.</p>
