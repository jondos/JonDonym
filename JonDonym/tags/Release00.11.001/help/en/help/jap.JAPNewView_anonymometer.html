<h2>The Anonym-O-Meter</h2>

<p>The Anonym-O-Meter displays visual information about the status and the
security of the selected service. Detailed information with more concrete data
can be reviewed at <a href="services.html">Details</a>.</p>

<p>From the information the Anonym-O-Meter gives, a partially subjective risk
of observation and a maximum level of anonymity can be deducted. The more
active users sending and receiving packets there are the higher the level of
anonymity for every single packet will be. That is because potentially every
user could have been the source of the packet. The number and distribution of
mix operators is also crucial: the more mixes there are in a cascade and the
further they are spread across the globe, the less likely will it be that a
user can be observed by an operator or third parties. Which value you should
prefer depends on the potential observer that you want to protect yourself
from. This evaluation provides, besides an informational function for the
users, also positive incentives for commercial mix operators to preferably form
secure cascades.</p>

      <td><img src="JAP.NewView_m66.anim.gif" alt="connected"></td>
      <td>A picture similar to this shows that you are connected to an
        anonymization service. The symbols measure the approximate level of
        anonymity offered by the active service. The left symbols (server
        icons) measures the number and regional or international distribution
        of the servers and operators (optimum: at least three operators,
        operators and mixes in three different countries = one blue and one
        green connection). The right symbol evaluates the number of active
        users on the service (optimum: at least 500). In pure number
        represenation, both values range from 0 to 6, separated by commas (e.g.
        5,4 / 6,6 - the two last values describe the theoretic maximum: first
        distribution, last users).</td>

        could be an error in the Infoservice, a slow internet connection, a
