Some remark about the french translation of JAP
===============================================

// frc  2003/04/17 09:25:26

1) This the first version of the french version of JAP. Despite my
   best efforts, this files probably contains typo or errors. If
   somebody finds errors, please let me know 

2) I've tried to make a pragmatic translation of the messages. This
   mean that sometimes I've used the english words (e.g "proxy"
   instead of "serveur de proximité") since these words are more often
   used, at least in the french part of Switzerland

3) Up to now, I've never find a tranlation of the term
   "Anonymizer". Therefore sometimes, when it was appropriate, I've
   used the sentence "Serveur d'anonymat" and sometimes I've let the
   english word. Maybe this should be fixed after some feedback of
   users.

4) No idea how to translate "listener" in french... I will ask my
   colleagues

5) Message "lang3" (line 21) should be "Français", but, since you have
   "German" instead "Deutsch" for "lang2"...
