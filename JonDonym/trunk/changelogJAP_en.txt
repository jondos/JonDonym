- does not freeze on close any more
- does not stay in memory after closing any more
- does not freeze on switching to Config any more
- does not freeze on switching anonymity or services any more
- does not not an empty window after minimizing to systray any more
  (Auto update of Windows-Dll)
- corrected a lot of german/english spelling mistakes and addes 
  missing texts
- revised several graphics
- removed several graphical errors (unclean or missing GUI updates,
  mainly in main window and in services view)
- noticeably accelerated closing 
- noticeably accelerated start
- accelerated overall performance, mainly when switching
  from main view to Config and the other way round
- configuration dialog does not need to be closed any more to
  accept the changes; just click on "Accept"
- configuration is automatically saved to disk when clicking on "Accept"
  or "OK", or if a new account has been created
- automatic (re-)connection on start and when connection has been lost
  works perfectly now
- automatic change to other service is possible if the current service
  cannot be reached any more after outage 
- if InfoService is unreachable, connections to services are now possible
  without switching-off all InfoService queries
- if InfoService is unreachable, all information over InfoServices
  and MixCascades are kept and are not deleted any more
- information over MixCascades/InfoServices are save in cofiguration file
  to be immediatly available on next start
- always several InfoServices (adjustable) are asked about information
  over MixCascades and InfoServices, to be as robust as possible against
  possible errors in or attacks of InfoServices (possibly not every IS
  holds all information about the network)
- keep all information about updates, mixes, InfoServices and so on
  in a central database that automatically removes outdated entries
  and allows for a very fast access
- in case of a "forced update" surfing via JAP is now still allowed,
  e.g. in order to download the update
- updates are downloaded automatically over anoynmous connection if
  they are otherwise not available, or if the user requests that
- proxy outages "behind" the service are recognized and interpreted 
  as connection errors
- connection errors do not lead to unnoticed non-anonymous surfing any 
  more; non-anonymous surfing must be allowed deliberatley
- new services are specially marked; additionally, the main window
  contains a noticeable message
- installation assistant helps shows the first steps with JAP 
  (especially browser configuration)
- mix certificates may be viewed and the certificate chains may be checked
- check for outdated certificates
- certificate chains of abitrary length are allowed
- information about MixCascades and InfoServices are requested from
  InfoService in short time intervals (about 10 Minutes); manual
  updates are no longer needed
- only changed information about mixes is reloaded from IS (very efficient!);; 
  already loaded MixInfos are saved in configuration and are immediatly
  available on next start
- information about mixes is now more detailed (e.g. E-Mail,
  location, certificates)
- certificates of InfoServices and certificate authorities may be
  viewed in detail, too
- activated and enhanced support for the beta version of the 
  payment system (create, charge and use pseudonymous accounts)
- deactivate experimental services (Tor/MixMinion) by default; 
  they may be (de-)activated manually, too
- updates are periodically and automatically retrieved and are shown
  by a mark in the main window and an optional pop-up, respective;
  automatic download is possible by a simple click
- update information for the latest Java version is also automatically 
  fetched from InfoService
- updates, InfoService information and data of the payment system are
  automatically retrieved over an anonymous connection, if they are
  otherwise unreachable or if the user forces this behaviour
- simple command-line user interface, ideal e.g. for servers without
  GUI
- help files reviewed completely
- font size alterable in steps
- skin support: all Java-LookAndFeels available in the internet 
  may be very easily integrated as plugin
- JAP can restart itself if needed (after update or major GUI change)
- enhanced general error tolerance, improved general code quality,
  removed a lot of other little bugs and pedestrian usage concepts...
