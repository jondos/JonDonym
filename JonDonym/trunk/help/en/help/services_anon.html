<h2>AN.ON/JonDonym</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this panel, press the button <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry
<code class="jconf">Anonymity</code> from the list to the left and open the tab
<code class="jconf">AN.ON/JonDonym</code>.</em></p>

<p>In order to better understand the information and settings in this panel,
you might first want to read the introduction to <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym und AN.ON</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="filter">Filter</a></h3>

<p>A so-called service filter determines to which services your JonDo may
connect. Depending on which filter you choose, the list below will display
services that match the criteria of the filter. The following filters are
available to you: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>All services</b><br>
    Displays all available services that are likely to offer sufficient
    bandwidth.</li>
  <li><p><b>Premium services</b><br>
    Displays only premium services that show good performance data.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Free services</b><br>
    Hides all services that are not free and unlikely to offer sufficient
    performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Services added by yourself </b><br>
    This filter shows only those services that you have <a
    href="#manuell">added by yourself</a>, for example for testing a specific
    service that is not automatically propagated by the <a
    href="infoservice.html">InfoService</a>. <strong>Please note that manually
    added services are, if you are using the filter "Services added by
    yourself", not checked for <a href="certificates.html">valid
    certificates</a> upon connection to them. Third parties with access to your
    internet connection may then forge a connection to such services, and may
    thereby launch a man-in-the-middle attack on you while decrypting all of
    your connections through them. You therefore should use this filter for the
    very first connection only in order to get the service data, and switch to
    another filter afterwards.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the help of <i><b>user defined filters</b></i> you can determine the
selection criteria yourself. This filter, in contrast to the predefined
filters, also offers the possibility of combining multiple criteria. Click the
button <b>Edit filter</b> to create your own filter. You can adjust the
following selection criteria to your needs: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Cascade length</b><br>
    Determine whether a single mix is acceptable or whether you only want to
    use mix cascades. </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    When using a single mix service, your privacy will only be protected if the
    respective operator is completely trustworthy. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Operator</b><br>
    Here you may decide if you would like to hide services because of the
    participation of a certain organization or individual as a mix operator.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Internationality</b><br>
    Determine how many different nations have to participate in the service.
    This includes the location of the mix operating organizations and also the
    geographic location of the servers themselves.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The more internationalization, the more secure the service should be
    esteemed. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Quality</b><br>
    Choose whether only <a href="jondonym.html#premium">premium</a>, only free
    or all services are displayed. </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The quality of the premium services is superior to that of the free
    services in the important aspects security, speed and availability. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Speed and latency</b><br>
    Here you can set a minimum speed and a maximum latency that the service has
    to provide in order to meet your selection criteria.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After having adjusted all selection criteria to your likings, click <code
class="jconf">Accept</code> to activate your user defined filter. With <code
class="jconf">Abort</code> you can revert your settings. </p>

<p><b>Blocking single services</b></p>

<p>The checkboxes to the left of the service entries are checked at default for
all available services. Unchecking a box causes JonDo to no longer connect to
this service. This achieves even more detailed filtering of services than is
already possible with the user defined service filters.</p>

<h3><a name="serviceinfos">Information about the available services</a></h3>

<p>You can receive very detailed information about the different services. When
hovering with your mouse over an entry in the selection list below the service
filter you will be shown the address of the first mix and its access ports. To
the right of the list you will furthermore be shown the following information
about the selected service: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Anonymity</b><br>
    Shows two evaluations for the presented service, which have both influence
    on your anonymity: Distribution and user activity (<a
    href="jap.JAPNewView_anonymometer.html">refer to Anonym-O-Meter</a>). The
    higher the respective value is (maximum is 6), the better for your
    security. The respective theoretic maximum is shown after the slash
    (6,6).</p>
    <p>If all mix operators of this service are forced to perform special legal
    obligations which might influence anonymity in a negative way, a warning
    label&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/invalid.png"> is shown behind the
    anonymity evaluation. You may click on it to get further information.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>User count</b><br>
    The value displays the current number of users connected to the service.
    The higher the user count, the higher your privacy will be while using the
    service. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Speed</b><br>
    Displays the speed with which data is send and received in the cascade. The
    value is measured by the InfoServices and is calculated across all
    measurements from within the last hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Response time</b><br>
    Displays the time that passes between sending a data packet and receiving
    the response data. The value is measured by the InfoServices and is
    calculated across all measurements from within the last hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Availability</b><br>
    You can recognize from this information how reliable and stable the
    selected service works. The value is measured by the InfoServices and is
    calculated across all measurements from within the last hour. Also if this
    service is for some reason not available for you information about this
    will be shown here. If you click on the message, a dialog with further
    explanations will open.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The data is further concretized in the lower part of the window. For every
mix of the selected service a symbol will be shown. You can tell the number of
mixes in a cascade from it. The flag symbols to the right of the mix symbols
indicate the nationality of the mix operator (lower flag) and the geographic
location of the mix (upper flag). If there is only one flag next to the mix
symbol it means that the operator and the mix are located in the same country.
Flags with a colored border give a quick overview on the <a
href="certificates.html#status">certification status</a> of the respective
Mix.</p>

<p>Click on a mix symbol or on the right/left arrows to receive the following
information about the respective mix of the cascade: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Mix name</b><br>
    The name of this Mix as given by its operator.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Mix location</b><br>
    The geographic location of the server is shown here. The flag symbol to the
    left shows at a glance in which country the mix is located.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Operator</b><br>
    The name of the organization that operates the selected mix. The flag
    symbol to the left depicts the country in which the mix operator is
    located. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Certificates (Button)</b><br>
    The icon of this button shows you the <a
    href="certificates.html#status">certification status</a> of the respective
    mix at a glance. A click on it opens details about the certificates. (<a
    href="certificates.html">Further information about certificates...</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>E-Mail (Button)</b><br>
    A click opens your e-mail program with the address of the operator of the
    respective mix. Moreover, you may see the e-mail address when moving your
    mouse over the button.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Homepage (Button)</b><br>
    A click opens your browser with the address of the operator of the
    respective mix. Moreover, you may see the homepage address when moving your
    mouse over the button.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Map (Button)</b><br>
    If the mix operator publishes detailled location information about his
    server, you may see this on a map which opens on clicking.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Law (Button)</b><br>
    This button only appears if an operator is forced to perform special legal
    obligations which might influence anonymity in a negative way. It opens a
    web site with further explanations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
