    The type of the currently installed version is displayed here.  There are two possible types:  The "Release Version" has been thoroughly tested and includes only the functions that should have no bugs or conflicts.  The "Development Version" includes all functions that are available, even if they are only partially implemented or contain bugs or mistakes.

    For most users, we recommend the "Release Version".
