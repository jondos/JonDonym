<h2>Portlistener</h2>

<p>To find this panel, press the button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main
window, then choose the entry <i>Portlistener</i> from the list to the
left.<br>
For JonDo to anonymize communication over the Internet, it must be located
between the browser and the server on the Internet. Such type of intermediate
station is generally called a proxy. Most programs that communicate with the
internet can connect through such a proxy. The necessary settings for such a
connection are: the name of the computer (host) on which the proxy is running
and the port number on which the proxy accepts requests. In the case of
JonDo, the host is the local computer itself and the port number is 4001 by
default. This setting can almost always be left at default.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Listening port number</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Port number</b><br>
    Enter the port number on which JonDo should accept connections from your
    browser here. Please note that the settings in your browser also need to
    be <a href="browser.html">changed</a> to reflect changes made here. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Allow access to JonDo from localhost only</b><br>
    If you check this box, only your own computer will be able to connect to
    JonDo. If the box is left unchecked, all computers that share a
    connection with you on your LAN can connect to your JonDo and use it to
    surf anonymously. For security reasons, it is recommended that this box
    be left unchecked as long as you don't have a specific reason to allow
    other local computers access to your JonDo.</li>
</ul>
