<h2>JonDonym, AN.ON and Tor</h2>

<p>The anonymization service JonDonym, a technical branch from the <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">AN.ON Project</a>, consists of multiple
user selectable mix cascades. A cascade itself consists of three mix servers
operated by independent and non interrelated organizations or private
individuals who all <a href="certificates.html">publish their identity</a>.
The operators have to abide by strict provisions which prohibit saving
connection data or exchanging such data with other operators in a cascade.
Every connection from a user is re-encrypted by every mix server within a
cascade and transferred through the cascade to the target, e.g. a website.
The aim of multiple encryption and processing is to make sure no mix operator
can by himself alone expose the user, and that eavesdropping on the
connection (Internet provider, WLAN) produces zero useful content. Also,
since a lot of users surf the anonymization service simultaneously, and thus
share the same IP address, all connections of every user are concealed amidst
each other: any user could have been the source of a certain connection. This
procedure ensures that no mix operator or external party (Internet provider,
WLAN sniffers, websites) can discover who has initiated a certain connection
or what connections a certain user has made.</p>

<p>JonDonym has some very specific advantages to other anonymization
services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Strong encryption and authentication:</b> Nobody can read the
    traffic between your PC and the JonDonym service.</li>
  <li><b>Protection from the mix operator:</b> Unless all mix operators in a
    JonDonym cascade are forced separately to monitor you, your internet
    connections are safe. The mix operators are revaluated regularly
    concerning seriosity and professionalism. Their identity is made public
    also. Even in the highly improbable case that they all are forced to
    unmask a certain connection, this function would have to be compiled into
    each server software first.</li>
  <li><b>No logfiles:</b> Saving any logfiles with IP addresses, even for
    seconds, is forbidden to the mix operators by contract.</li>
  <li><b>Transparent functionality:</b> Informative GUI, published concepts
    and open, OSI compliant sourcecode of all software components.</li>
  <li><b>No software backdoor:</b> There is no possibility to inspect single
    connections in the <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> client. The software
    runs completely on your PC and can not be manipulated without your
    approval. No identity, serial number or account number is transmitted
    during update.</li>
  <li><b>Secure browser profile:</b> With <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> you are given a Firefox profile for
    free which has been especially developed for anonymous and secure surfing
    with JonDonym.</li>
  <li><b>Portable anonymity:</b> <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> runs without
    installation on the PC directly from a portable USB stick (Windows / Mac
    OS X).</li>
  <li><b>Evolution by research:</b> Scientific work conducted at the
    Technical University of Dresden (AN.ON), the University of Regensburg
    (AN.ON) and at the JonDos GmbH (JonDonym) enhances and improves the
    system.</li>
  <li><b>Competent, fast and at no charge:</b> Detailed help, monitored user
    forum, email support.</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar standard of anonymization can only be offered by the
non-commercial system <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>, which we
recommend to advanced Internet users in addition to JonDonym. Internet
beginners and computer novices should be careful with Tor: there is no
control over who runs the servers in this service over which your data
travels. In the past, there has been ongoing suspicion that criminals and
intelligence agencies exploit the Tor network in order to secretly attain
unencrypted information like passwords, bank accounts and credit cards.
Certain tricks can enable the Tor server to concentrate much of the traffic
on itself, making the exploit even more effective. Tor may be set as <a
href="net.html">proxy in JonDo</a> though, making surfing slower but even
more secure than with JonDonym alone because the last servers in this chain
will be part of the verified JonDonym network.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, every last mix server in a JonDonym cascade could
record data which is not separately secured by HTTPS/SSL. Unlike Tor and
other services, in JonDonym only seriosity certified and publicized persons
and organizations may operate a mix server. The user may then decide for
himself on whether he trusts the operator or not. All this makes it highly
improbable for criminal operators to infiltrate JonDonym and go about
unpunished.</p>

<h3><a name="premium" id="premium">Premium services</a></h3>

<p>With JonDonym you can choose between free services and the premium
services which are subject to a charge. <b>By this voluntary prepaid payment
for premium services you support the preservation and improvement of the
JonDonym system</b>. The premium services offer these additional advantages
to the basic JonDonym:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Guaranteed performance:</b> Speed of at least 100 kbit/s and
    latencies of 4 seconds maximum during 90% of the day. Free services, also
    Tor, are usually much slower.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed access</b>: A connection to the JonDonym system is
    guaranteed all the time.</li>
  <li><b>Legal certainty:</b> Development, support and billing addresses are
    all located in Germany and not at some anonymous offshore company without
    a summonable address. Germany sets worldwide standards in customer
    protection.</li>
  <li><b>Three-Operator-Guarantee:</b> Every mix cascade is run by three
    organizations or persons that are independent from each other.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed internationality:</b> Mixes and operators of a cascade
    are spread over at least two countries. This ensures that no large
    network node (CIX) can monitor all data traffic. And it cripples every
    national data retention since not all mixes in a cascade do log.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed connection:</b> The mix operators do not block any
    Internet ports.</li>
  <li><b>Soon: SOCKS support</b>: You can use the SOCKS protocol aside HTTP
    to anonymize most Internet applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to use premium services, create a <a
href="payment_account.html">disposable account</a> and activate it by an
anonymous or non anonymous <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">payment
of your choice</a>. After that you will have a certain amount of data volume
at your disposal, <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">depending on
your chosen rate,</a> to be used with the premium services. Once it is
depleted, you can create and activate another disposable account any time.</p>

<p>Advice on protection of personal information: for accurate clearing of
data volumes with the mix operators it is saved how much volume an account
has used cumulatively on a mix cascade. These clearings happen no sooner than
on a daily basis. An allocation of accounts to user identities is not saved.
It is technically impossible to recognize requested websites by the deducted
data volumes alone, even when monitoring accurately to the second (maximum
accuracy).</p>
