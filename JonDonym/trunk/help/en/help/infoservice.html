<h2>InfoService</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">This window is only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert View</a>. To get there, click <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in the main window and choose <code
class="jconf">InfoService</code> from the list on the left side.</em><br>
</p>

<p>The InfoService delivers necessary information to JonDo about available
services and updates. Multiple InfoSerivces of different organizations are
available in JonDonym. They share and match their data so that they all have
the same information in the end. This ensures availabilty of the information.
Most information is requested redundantly so that no single InfoService may
fake or conceal information.</p>

<p><b>Please beware</b><br>
Changing these settings may render JonDo incapable of discovering any
services.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
On this page, you can see the InfoServices that are known to your JonDo
client. The currently preferred InfoService appears in bold. You can take the
following actions: 
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Refresh list</b><br>
    Here you can download a new list of InfoServices. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Set as default</b><br>
    By clicking this button the selected InfoService will be chosen as the
    default InfoService. This default InfoService will be contacted first for
    <a href="#infoservice_redundat">redundant requests</a> and it will not be
    deleted from the list of available InfoServices, even if it may be
    temporarily unavailable. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Certificate</b><br>
    A click on this button will show the certificate for this InfoService and
    its operator. JonDo only accepts information from InfoServices that have
    identified with a trustworthy certificate.</p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The certificates of the preset InfoServices are already included in
    JonDo. </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add...</b><br>
    When you choose this action, an additional input area for manually adding
    an InfoService appears at below. 
    <p><em>These settings are usually not needed as InfoServices are
    discovered automatically.</em></p>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>InfoService host</b><br>
        Enter here the host name or IP address of the InfoService that you
        want to add. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>InfoService port</b><br>
        Enter the port of the new InfoService here. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>InfoService name</b><br>
        If you like, you can enter a name for the InfoService here. The new
        InfoService then appears with this name in the list of known
        InfoServices. If the field is left empty the InfoService is listed as
        a combination of host name and port. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Add</b><br>
        Click this button to confirm your entry and insert the new
        InfoService. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Cancel</b><br>
        Discard changes and return to the previous window.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This part of the window also appears if you select an InfoService
    which has already been entered manually. You may then change this
    InfoService's data or delete it. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Remove</b><br>
    When you click on this button the selected InfoService will be removed
    from the list of known InfoServices.</p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    Deleting the default or preset InfoServices is impossible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><a name="infoservice_auto"><b>Enable automatic InfoService requests</b><br>
    JonDo regularly attempts to connect to the InfoService to update the
    information saved locally. If this checkbox is not set these automatic
    connections will cease. <strong>You have to update the InfoService data
    by clicking the different refresh buttons in the respective windows
    regularly. Otherwise program functionality may not be
    guaranteed.</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Allow non-anonymous (direct) connections to InfoServices</b><br>
    If activated, JonDo can connect to InfoServices even if you have no
    anonymized connection available. This is the recommended setting as there
    is really no need to be anonymous to the InfoServices.<br>
    If this option is deactivated, information from InfoServices may be
    gathered through anonymized connections only. <strong>This may make it
    impossible to connect to InfoServices at all.</strong>.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="infoservice_redundat"><b>Do redundant requests to different InfoServices</b><br>
    Define how many InfoServices will be queried. If you set this value to
    <code>3</code>, for example, JonDo will always try to reach 3
    InfoServices for the requested information. Should one of them be offline
    JonDo will try to reach the other two. The higher the value the more
    resilient against malfunction JonDo will become but the more time these
    queries will consume also. The default InfoService will always be
    contacted first. <em>In the beta version you can completely deactivate
    this option so that only the default InfoService will be asked, no matter
    whether it is available or not. This may make it impossible to connect to
    InfoServices at all.</em> </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Connection timeout</b><br>
    If your internet connection is too slow a timeout for requests of the
    information set too short may prevent JonDo from establishing a
    connection and receiving the information. A timeout set too high may
    cause long waiting times if one or more InfoServices are slow or
    unavailable. Therefore, lower or raise the timeout as needed. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
