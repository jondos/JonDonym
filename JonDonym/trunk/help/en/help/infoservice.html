<h2>InfoService</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">This window is only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert View</a>. To get there, click <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in the main window and choose <code
class="jconf">InfoService</code> from the list on the left side.</em><br>
</p>

<p>The InfoService delivers necessary information to JonDo about available
services and updates. Multiple InfoSerivces of different organizations are
available in JonDonym. They share and match their data so that they all have
the same information in the end. This ensures availability of the information.
Most information is requested redundantly so that no single InfoService may
fake or conceal information.</p>

<p><b>Please beware</b><br>
Changing these settings may render JonDo incapable of discovering any
services.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>
On this page, you can see the InfoServices that are known to your JonDo client.
The currently preferred InfoService appears in bold. You can take the following
actions: 
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Refresh list</b><br>
    Here you can download a new list of InfoServices. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Set as default</b><br>
    By clicking this button the selected InfoService will be chosen as the
    default InfoService. This default InfoService will be contacted first for
    <a href="#infoservice_redundat">redundant requests</a> and it will not be
    deleted from the list of available InfoServices, even if it may be
    temporarily unavailable. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Certificate</b><br>
    A click on this button will show the certificate for this InfoService and
    its operator. JonDo only accepts information from InfoServices that have
    identified with a trustworthy certificate.</p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The certificates of the preset InfoServices are already included in JonDo.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Add...</b><br>
    When you choose this action, an additional input area for manually adding
    an InfoService appears at below. 
    <p><em>These settings are usually not needed as InfoServices are discovered
    automatically.</em></p>
    <br>

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>InfoService host</b><br>
        Enter here the host name or IP address of the InfoService that you want
        to add. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>InfoService port</b><br>
        Enter the port of the new InfoService here. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>InfoService name</b><br>
        If you like, you can enter a name for the InfoService here. The new
        InfoService then appears with this name in the list of known
        InfoServices. If the field is left empty the InfoService is listed as a
        combination of host name and port. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Add</b><br>
        Click this button to confirm your entry and insert the new InfoService.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Cancel</b><br>
        Discard changes and return to the previous window.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This part of the window also appears if you select an InfoService which
    has already been entered manually. You may then change this InfoService's
    data or delete it. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Remove</b><br>
    When you click on this button the selected InfoService will be removed from
    the list of known InfoServices.</p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    Deleting the default or preset InfoServices is impossible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Anonymous connections to InfoServices</b><br>
    <em>Only if direct connection is not possible</em> makes JonDo connect to
    InfoServices through the currently active JonDonym service if the
    respective InfoService is not available through a direct connection. This
    could for example be the case if your ISP blocks access to the InfoService.
    </p>
    <p><em>Always (deny non-anonymous connection)</em> will result in
    InfoServices being contacted only through JonDonym services. <strong>By
    setting this, you may under circumstances no longer be able to receive
    updated information about the JonDonym network, and as a consequence, no
    longer, or only to some extent, be able to connect to anonymization
    services.</strong></p>
    <em>Never (allow direct connection only)</em> can make sense if you want to
    cut cost. For <strong>InfoService data transmitted through premium JonDonym
    services will for compelling technical reasons be accounted for just like
    any other user data</strong>. This setting blocks any requests of
    InfoService data through the anonymous connection.<br>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="infoservice_auto"></a><b>Enable automatic InfoService
    requests</b><br>
    JonDo regularly attempts to connect to the InfoServices to update the
    information saved locally. If this box is not checked these automatic
    connections will cease. <strong>You will then have to update the
    InfoService data by clicking the different refresh buttons in the
    respective windows regularly. Otherwise program functionality may not be
    guaranteed.</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><a name="infoservice_redundat"></a><b>Do redundant requests to
    different InfoServices</b><br>
    Define how many InfoServices will be queried. If you set this value to
    <code>3</code>, for example, JonDo will always try to reach 3 InfoServices
    for the requested information. Should one of them be offline JonDo will try
    to reach the other two. The higher the value the more resilient against
    malfunction JonDo will become but the more time these queries will consume
    also. The default InfoService will always be contacted first. <em>In the
    beta version you can completely deactivate this option so that only the
    default InfoService will be asked, no matter whether it is available or
    not. This may make it impossible to connect to InfoServices at all.</em>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Connection timeout</b><br>
    If your internet connection is too slow a timeout for requests of the
    information set too short may prevent JonDo from establishing a connection
    and receiving the information. A timeout set too high may cause long
    waiting times if one or more InfoServices are slow or unavailable.
    Therefore, lower or raise the timeout as needed. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
