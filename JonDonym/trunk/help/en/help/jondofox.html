<h2>JonDoFox - Bringing security and privacy to Firefox </h2>

<p>JonDoFox is a <a
href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser profile
particularly optimized for anonymous and secure web surfing<a
href="jondonym.html"></a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ffprofile" id="ffprofile">Profile installation</a></h3>

<p>This installation option integrates the JonDoFox profile and a locally
installed Firefox, so that JonDoFox operates seamlessly with your system. Any
previous Firefox configuration you may have created remains untouched by the
installation. After installing, you may choose between both your profile and
the JonDoFox configuration at each start of Firefox.</p>

<p>First, install <a
href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> on your system
if you haven't done so yet. After that, you may install JonDoFox as
follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="ffpwindows"><b>Windows</b></a> 
    <p>Launch the <a
    href="https://www.jondos.de/downloads/JonDoFox.paf.exe">JonDoFox
    installation program</a>, choose "lite" or "complete" and then follow the
    instructions. The installer is also suitable for a portable installation
    (see below).</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ffpmacosx"><b>Mac OS X</b></a> 
    <ol>
      <li>Download the file <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X.dmg">JonDoFox_OS_X.dmg</a>
        (also available as <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_lite.dmg">Lite
        version</a> with only the security relevant extensions).</li>
      <li>Open the file by double clicking. Then launch
        <em>JonDoFox_Install</em> with another double click.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The installer may also be used for deinstalling the previously installed
    profile, but <b>beware:</b><br>
    Please do not change the entries that the installer creates. Otherwise, a
    clean installation can not be guaranteed! Also, <b>only</b> use the
    installer for deinstallation if you have also used it for installing
    JonDoFox.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ffplinux"><b>Linux</b></a> 
    <ol>
      <li>Download the file <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/profile.zip">profile.zip</a>
        (also available as <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/profile_lite.zip">Lite
        version</a> with only the security relevant extensions).</li>
      <li>Unpack the file, e.g. from the command line, using the command:
        <code>user@computer#:/&gt; unzip profile.zip -d target</code>.</li>
      <li>Go to the directory where you placed the files:
        <code>user@computer#:/&gt; cd target</code>.</li>
      <li>To install JonDoFox, run the script <code>install_linux.sh</code>
        from there: <code>user@computer#:/<i>target</i>&gt;
        ./install_linux.sh</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notice</b><br>
When a new version of JonDoFox is released, you may always install the new
version "on top of" the old one, i.e. into the same directory. Your bookmarks
will be kept. </p>

<h3>Portable installation</h3>

<p>The portable version is recommended for removable drives. It will not
integrate with your system. If needed, you have to create any links to the
JonDoFox program files yourself.</p>

<h4>Windows (2000, XP, Vista)</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jondos.de/downloads/JonDoFox.paf.exe">JonDoFox
installation program</a> is also suitable for a portable installation. If you
choose the portable installation, you may install JonDoFox on both a
removable drive and your hard drive. Any existing Firefox or JonDoFox
installation remains untouched as long as you do not install JonDoFox to the
same directory and thus update an existing installation. While updating from
earlier JonDoFox versions your bookmarks are kept. JonDoFox Portable
automatically integrates with the <a
href="http://portableapps.com/">PortableApps</a> menu for which a lot of <a
href="http://portableapps.com/apps">other applications are available</a> as
well.</p>

<h4>for Mac OS X (10.4 or higher)</h4>

<p>(in preparation)</p>
<!--<p>You get a "portable" version of JonDoFox for Mac OS X 
<a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_portable.dmg">here</a>
(or, as an alternative, the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_lite_portable.dmg">lite
version</a>). You may start this version from both a removable drive and from
your hard drive. For installation, please open the downloaded file with a
double click. Then copy the included file on a data medium of your choice. You
may start it from there with a simple double click. </p> -->

<h3><a name="critical_addons">Security relevant Firefox extensions</a></h3>

<p>The JonDoFox lite package contains all extensions which are relevant for
your security, already with settings optimized. You will find some other
useful extensions in the complete package which we have individually tested
concerning their security and compatibility with JonDoFox. The Firefox status
bar always gives you control of the most important functions integrated in
JonDoFox: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img alt="Statuszeile JonDoFox (CSLite, NoScript, AdblockPlus, JonDoFox)"
src="img_jondofox/jondofox_statusbar.png"></div>

<h3>Control Cookies with CS-Lite </h3>

<p>Using CS-Lite, you may very conveniently determine for which websites to
accept cookies and for which to block them. If you click on the CS-Lite icon
<span class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/cslite.gif"
alt="CS-Lite Icon"></span> with your left mouse button, you are given the
following options for the currently visited web site: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img src="img_jondofox/cslite_menu.gif" alt="CS-Lite Men&uuml;"> </div>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_temp.gif)"><b>Allow
    temporarily</b><br>
    The Cookie is only accepted for the current browser session and will be
    removed afterwards. After browser restart, the website is no longer
    allowed to read or set a Cookie. <strong>This is the recommended
    setting.</strong></li>
  <li style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_session.gif)"><b>Allow
    for session</b><br>
    The Cookie is only accepted for the current browser session and will be
    removed afterwards. After browser restart, the website may set a new
    cookie.</li>
  <li
    style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_allow.gif)"><b>Allow</b><br>
    The cookie is stored in the browser as long as the website defined. It
    may be kept and accessed by the web site even after browser restart. </li>
  <li
    style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_remove.gif)"><b>Remove</b><br>
    Any rule you set for the website before is removed. The website is no
    longer allowed to read or set a cookie.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should never use the option <span
class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/cslite_global.gif"
alt="CS-Lite: Cookies global akzeptieren"> <b>Allow Cookies
Globally</b></span> if possible. This allows cookies from all websites that
have not been explicitly <span class="nowrap"><img
src="img_jondofox/cslite.gif" alt="CS-Lite: Cookies global akzeptieren">
<b>blocked</b></span>, and others may track your steps on the Web.</p>

<h3>Filter advertizements with AdblockPlus</h3>

<p>AdblockPlus <img alt="AdblockPlus" src="img_jondofox/abp-enabled-16.png">
is an advertizement filter that runs in the background. Usually, you do not
have to alter its settings. However, you may add your own filter lists any
time.</p>

<h3>Control active contents with NoScript</h3>

<p>NoScript <img src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif" alt="NoScript-Icon"> lets
you conveniently control which potential dangerous scripts and plugins from a
website your browser may execute or not.</p>

<h4>Controlling installed plugins</h4>

<p>When you visit a website containing plugin content like Flash movies or
Java applets, this content will be automatically blocked by NoScript. A
placeholder (left image) is shown instead of the active content: </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-right:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_placeholder.gif"
        alt="NoScript-Platzhalter"> </span> </td>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_blocked.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Geblockte Objekte Men&uuml;"> </span> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You may allow the content by clicking on the placeholder or by choosing
the respective option in <span><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript_blockedcontent.gif"
alt="NoScript: Geblockte Objekte"> <b>Blocked Objects</b></span> after
clicking on the NoScript menu icon <img src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif"
alt="NoScript-Icon">. </p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Without <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/jondofox/faq#12n1327">special protective
measures</a>, allowed plugin content may completely or partially revoke your
anonymity and might even damage your system.</p>

<h4>Controlling JavaScript</h4>

<p>If you click on the NoScript icon<span class="nowrap"><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif" alt="NoScript-Icon"></span> you get a list of
all addresses/service providers with JavaScript code on the currently visited
web site. The respective entries are marked with the<span class="nowrap"><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript_temp.gif"
alt="NoScript tempor&auml;r erlauben"></span> icon: </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-right:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_allow.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Erlaubnis erteilen"> </span> </td>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_disallow.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Erlaubnis entziehen"> </span> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>By clicking on <span><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_temp.gif"
alt="NoScript tempor&auml;r erlauben"> <b>Temporarily allow</b></span> you
activate scripts for this entry. By another click, as shown in the right
image, you may easily remove this permission again. If you would like to
remove the permissions for all addresses, you just have to click on
<span><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_disallowall.gif"
alt="NoScript: Tempor&auml;re Berechtigungen aufheben"> <b>Revoke temporary
permissions</b></span>.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should give as few permissions as possible,
and if possible only for the currently visited website. Third party scripts
are often only used to spy on you and are rarely needed for proper
functionality of the website.</p>

<p>If you generally distrust any address you may classify it
<em>untrusted</em>, and it will no more show up within the addresses you
might allow. In order to make this classification, move your mouse over the
option <span class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_untrwicon.gif"
alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig"> <b>Untrusted</b>.</span> Then,
you get an overview of all the addresses on the current website which you may
mark untrusted: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img src="img_jondofox/noscript_untrustw.gif"
alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig Men&uuml;"> </div>

<p>You may undo this action just the same way. </p>

<h3>Switching proxies</h3>

<p>If you would like to surf the Web with a different (local) proxy than
JonDo or without any proxy, just use the button <img alt="JonDo-Proxy"
src="img_jondofox/jondofox_jondo.png"> integrated in JonDoFox (down right) in
order to switch between different proxy configurations: </p>

<p><img alt="JonDoFox-Popup" src="img_jondofox/jondofox_popup.png"></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>No Proxy</b>: If no proxy is set, JonDoFox directly connects to the
    Internet. <strong>Attention: Your IP address will be sent in plain and is
    not hidden!</strong></li>
  <li><b>Custom</b>: Using this setting, you may use your own proxy
    configuration. Choose <span class="nowrap"><img
    src="img_jondofox/servermanuell.gif"
    alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig"> <b>Edit Custom
    Proxy</b></span> in order to create an individual proxy configuration.
    However, this is only recommended for experts.</li>
  <li><b>Tor</b>: If you have installed and started the program <a
    href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> you may use it as an alternative
    to JonDo with this setting.</li>
  <li><b>JonDo</b>: When this setting is active, JonDoFox sends the browser's
    communication data to JonDo. JonDo needs to be separately <a
    href="https://www.jondos.de/en/download">installed and started</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever you like to bypass the proxy without completely deactivating it
(e.g. when downloading large files to save time and money), just open the
context menu with a right mouse click on the file and choose <em>Bypass
JonDo/Tor/Proxy and Save Link As...</em></p>

<h3>Downloading videos</h3>

<p>To prevent having to activate dangerous Flash in your browser, you should
always download web videos to your hard drive and play them from there. This
also saves you the additional traffic which would be needed to view a
streaming video again. JonDoFox contains some download tools for doing this.
For Windows and Linux (under WINE), there also exists an excellent freeware
program called <a href="http://atube-catcher.dsnetwb.com">aTube Catcher</a>.
You may configure this program for JonDo by activating the HTTP proxy in
aTube Catcher in <strong><em>Tools-&gt;Connection settings</em></strong> and
setting it to <strong><em>Host:127.0.0.1</em></strong> and <strong><em>Port:
4001</em></strong></p>

<p><img alt="aTube Catcher Connection settings: HTTP proxy 127.0.0.1:4001"
src="img_jondofox/aTubeCatcherConnection.png"></p>

<p>For playing movies of all video formats on all operating systems, the free
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN Media Player</a> is a very good
choice.</p>
