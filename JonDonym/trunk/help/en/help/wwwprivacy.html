<h2>The World Wide Web and your privacy</h2>

<p>Most likely, you too can no longer imagine day-to-day life without the
World Wide Web. Those numerous services such as online banking, travel
information, encyclopedias or the like mean a great convenience in solving
common tasks. Furthermore, you probably surf entertainment and shopping
portals, stay in touch with friends over social networks or share your common
interests with others in forums. To access the Web you are offered a dozen of
stable, highly functional yet easy to use applications, the so-called
browsers. The most popular browsers are the Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Opera, Safari and Google Chrome.</p>
<!--<div class="topdown_navi">

</div>-->

<p>Any communication on the Internet leaves all kinds of digital traces which
can be automatically acquired, saved and analyzed. Some companies have thus
specialized in creating individual user profiles from surfing related data.
These databases are of high economic value since they allow an enterprise to
comprehensively profile their costumers, a process called <a
href="http://www.schober.de/site/index.php?id=137">data accumulation</a> in
data mining lingo.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why one should avoid leaving digital traces when
surfing: part of the data collected advects into scoring systems which are
used to evaluate loan requests, to create individually priced offers or to
decide on eligibility for C.O.D. service. Employers may be generated a
character profile of their job applicants from traces on the Net prior to
hiring them. Freedom of opinion is limited by governments or institutions
where they trace individual surfers that use or edit certain web services or
deny them any usage at all. Companies may recognize employees of other
businesses or even those of their competition, trace them and subsequently
annoy them with promotional calls or email spam. Browser related data exposes
vulnerabilities in the surfing machine which may allow for a subsequent
direct attack on it.</p>

<p>Further problematic is that these traces <b>are collected, saved, sent and
processed without your consent and most widely unnoticed.</b> The actual
techniques employed by the data miners on the Web are briefly introduced
below.</p>
<!--<div class="topdown_navi">

<h3>Active Webcontent</h3>

<p>Webcontent accessible by browser plugins such as Flash, Java, ActiveX and
Silverlight renders the Web more dynamic and colorful but also more
dangerous, for they allow websites to execute code on your PC. By certain
manipulations these plugins can read and edit files on your machine and in an
extreme case even gain complete control over it. Especially beware signed
Java applets: by accepting its signature the applet and thereby the visited
webserver automatically receive all user rights on your machine. It does not
help to only surf websites you deem trustworthy either. This concept is
outdated since nowadays even large and notorious websites are hacked and
filled with malicious code on a massive scale.</p>

<p>The browser scripting language JavaScript is a little more resilient to
attacks than the aforementioned plugins but still not safe. Therefore we
recommend you turn on JavaScript only as needed and switch it off otherwise.
In any case, you should, if you care about your PC's security and your
privacy that is, deinstall the above mentioned active plugins and no longer
use them. Most websites will still be reachable. YouTube videos and videos of
other such portals which are rendered by Flash may be downloaded with special
software and then viewed safely with a video player. Websites which demand
usage of active plugins should be avoided if possible.</p>

<p>You should not surf the Internet without a well secured browser. Your PC
will otherwise be compromised soon. Instead of configuring the browser
yourself, which takes quite some experience, you could also use <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> for free. This Mozilla Firefox based
browser does not only block all active content at default (you can turn this
back on if needed) it is also equipped with further ample security
mechanisms.</p>

<h3><a name="cookies">Cookies</a></h3>

<p>Without cookies, certain services would be complicated to realize in a
webserver. After sending a page, the webserver can not readily match requests
of further pages to that same user. This protects the privacy of every
websurfer, especially with search engines. Nevertheless, some services do
require a sort of memory. Shopping portals are an example having the server
to remember what goods were placed into the virtual shopping cart. This
"memory" is usually written into cookies, i.e. small text files which are
being sent to you by the server upon every page request. If your browser
contacts the server again, it also automatically sends back the cookie stored
earlier. The server thereby "remembers" which virtual shopping cart was
yours.</p>

<p>But cookies can also be abused to track your steps on the Internet. This
works exceptionally well with web portals (e.g. Yahoo) and search engines
(e.g. Google), in particular if you use these a lot in order to reach other
websites. With cookies, a web host can record large parts of your surfing
behavior over years and easily relate it to a person. Some internet users
have collected hundreds of cookies from various websites on the PC. You
should thus, in any case and at the latest, delete cookies after your browser
session. Modern browsers usually integrate an optional function for that, but
it has to be activated by the user first. In <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> this has been made the default.</p>
<!--<div class="topdown_navi">
<a href="#doctop"> Beginn &uarr; </a><a href="#docbottom"> &darr; Ende </a>
</div>-->

<h3>Webbugs and Banner Ads</h3>

<p>Very likely, you will find one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> in
your browser from data miners such as <a
href="http://www2.infonline.de/">ivwbox.de (INFONLINE)</a>, <a
href="http://www.doubleclick.com/">doubleclick.net</a>, <a
href="http://www.advertisement.com/">advertisement.com</a> or <a
href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, although you have never even visited
their websites. These enterprises use a simple trick to plant cookies on you
and watch your browsing nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Webbugs" are usually pictures of 1x1 pixels and therefore invisible to
the viewer, but they can also be coded into banner ads embedded in a website.
The website contains a picture (webbug) that is loaded from another server
running a statistics service (such as Doubleclick, Google Analytics). Thereby
the statistics service may set or edit a cookie in your browser unnoticeably.
The browser will then send this cookie back to the statistics service with
every new request for its webbugs. If the service is used on many websites,
it can now track large parts of your browsing session. On top of that,
assuming the owner of the statistics service collaborates with the owner of
your preferred search engine, he now has an almost complete picture of your
internet activity.</p>

<p>In order to prevent session tracking, all cookies should be blocked at
default and only allowed in for the duration of a session, if needed. The
privacy functions of current browsers which either flatly deny all cookies or
only deny those from third parties do unfortunately not achieve optimal
protection. <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> is therefore preconfigured
to deny all cookies but allow single websites at the expense of two mouse
clicks. We recommend allowing cookies only on a temporary basis, so that they
will be automatically blocked again after the session.</p>

<h3>Browser Header</h3>

<p>With every request for a webpage, browsers send information within the
framework of the http protocol that can be analyzed by the site: language,
browser name and version, operating system and version, the last visited
webpage, supported charsets, files and codecs. Sending these headers is not
necessary for rendering websites, but it can be exploited for reidentifying,
profiling and analyzing websurfers.</p>

<p>As of today, different filter applications and services have been
developed that allow hiding or changing telltale browser headers (e.g.
Privoxy, Proxomitron). Unfortunately, these applications can not filter
encrypted connections: once you load a presumably "secure" website (HTTPS,
browser lock) all filtering fails. Plus, these programs allow every user to
define the header data himself. But setting an individual browser type e.g.
is in itself what renders you quasi perfectly trackable. Therefore, in
<b>JonDo</b>, an automatic filtering has been integrated which allocates an
uniform header profile at least for unencrypted connections (HTTP). Those who
want to achieve a higher level of security should rely on <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> though. It sends the same profile for
encrypted connections too.</p>

<h3>Browser History</h3>

<p>Applying certain tricks, websites can tell which other websites are saved
in your browser history. For this, the "spying" website sends special
formatting commands (CSS, Stylesheets) that are executed automatically, e.g.
downloading an image, if one of the websites mentioned in the formatting
commands is found in your browser history. The website can then tell that you
have visited that particular address before. This technique may of course be
applied to hundreds of addresses simultaneously instead of just one.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is no reliable protection against this technique,
which is why the browser history should be deleted at the end of every
session, or better yet deactivated. Both has been made default in <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. A reliable protection against this is in
development.</p>

<h3>Browser Cache</h3>

<p>From the contents of your browser cache one can conclude on previously
visited, thus already cached, websites: the time required for loading a
website changes when part of it is already in the browser cache. By subtle
placement of the images on the website, which are loaded one by one, the
server can analyze the cache one by one.</p>

<p>Unlike deactivating your browser history, deactivating your cache would
have tremendous effect on your surfing speed, which is why we don't recommend
it. In <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> a protective mechanism has been
integrated instead which bypasses cache for third party content. Also, the
cache is deleted automatically when you close the browser. A website can thus
no longer gain information about other websites, only about itself.</p>

<h3><a name="ip" id="ip">IP address</a></h3>

<p>The IP address is given to you by your provider on dialing into the
Internet, and it is then saved for months or even years together with your
customer data and your online time. It is a distinct identifier on the
Internet which is sent along whenever you make a direct connection to any
internet service. This address tells the server where to send his response.
As long as your IP does not change, it is easy to monitor when and what
website you have contacted, and what data was retrieved. The IP also reveals
your provider, many times your location and, in case of a company or computer
center, usually what terminal you are on. In many cases, an IP address
relates directly to one person. Some of the information that is given away by
your IP or browser can be reviewed on the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/de/anontest">JonDos test page</a>.</p>

<p>While the traces mentioned so far can be blurred without any special
services needed, the same can not be said about your IP address. In order to
blur any connection between your IP and the websites you visit, the software
<a href="about.html">JonDo</a> connects to the service <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a>. This service then interlaces the servers
of different organizations with your PC and the Internet. You are now surfing
with the IP of the respectively last PC within a chain/cascade of a few
so-called mix servers. The data sent by you is separately encrypted for every
mix server and slightly altered in size and sequence so that nobody can
eavesdrop or guess on your data stream. You are therewith protected from any
observation as long as all service providers of a JonDonym cascade do not
cooperate against you.</p>
