<h2>JonDo's features</h2>

<h3>JonDo - The Privacy Generator</h3>

<p>The program JonDo (a branch of <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">JAP</a>) allows your browser to visit
websites through an <a href="wwwprivacy.html#ip">IP address</a> within the <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a> system and to encrypt your data traffic. This
means that neither the contacted server, nor any eavesdropper on your
connections, nor the operators of the JonDonym service themselves can realize
which websites you surf. The usage of <a
href="jondonym.html#premiumservices">premium services</a> moreover allows for
an additional anonymization of the following applications besides browsers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IRC Chat Clients (e.g. Chatzilla, integrated in <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>).</li>
  <li>Messengers (e.g. <a href="http://pidgin.im/download/">Pidgin</a>,
    recommend with the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> protocol and
    the <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/#downloads">OTR plugin</a>).</li>
  <li>And basically all programs for which you can configure a HTTP proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Email clients and VoIP are not yet supported. To send anonymous emails we
recommend you dispense with email clients and resort to web based mail services
over the browser.</p>

<h3>What is JonDo?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo is an application that spoofs your own IP for internet access using
    certain applications (e.g. by the web browser).</li>
  <li>JonDo multiply encrypts the data sent over JonDonym. Neither your access
    provider nor JonDonym operators (except for the last one in each <a
    href="jondonym.html">cascade</a>) can see your plaintext data.</li>
  <li>JonDo is an <a
    href="forwarding_client.html">Anti-Censorship-Application</a> that allows
    access to otherwise blocked Internet sites. Users may configure their JonDo
    as a <a href="forwarding_server.html">forwarding server</a> in order to
    allow others access to the JonDonym service.</li>
  <li>JonDo is open source and free. The program offers access to both free and
    paid (premium) services.</li>
  <li>JonDo filters and anonymizes <a href="wwwprivacy.html#header">HTTP
    headers</a> - but only for unencrypted connections (not HTTPS). You should
    additionally use <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> in order to also
    filter encrypted connections.</li>
  <li>JonDo is available on all major systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).</li>
  <li>JonDo was and is developed by the <a
    href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a> in cooperation with German
    universities (<a href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, <a
    href="http://www-sec.uni-regensburg.de">Universit&auml;t Regensburg</a>)
    and privacy organizations (<a
    href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de">Unabh&auml;ngiges Landeszentrum
    f&uuml;r Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is not JonDo?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo does NOT make your router's IP invisible. Your IP address is
    assigned to you by your ISP, and it is inalterable by third parties. You
    need the IP so that the JonDo client may successfully connect to JonDonym
    services on the Internet. When using JonDo, you are surfing with servers
    (mixes) on the Internet that all have their own separate IP address. The
    websites accessed by you will only see this respective outgoing address and
    not yours.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT regularly change the outgoing IP address, but retains the
    same outgoing IP as long as it stays connected to the same mix cascade.
    This could be minutes, hours or even days. The IPs of JonDonym mixes are
    public anyways. Changing the outgoing IP would therefore not achieve
    additional security.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT hide the MAC address of your PC or router. The MAC address
    is used by your ISP to assign you your IP address in the first place, and
    it should not be visible on the Internet besides that anyhow.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT a filesharing anonymization tool. You may run certain P2P
    applications with JonDo, but you will not be able to upload data
  yourself.</li>
  <li>JonDo can NOT anonymize emails. This would require special, additional
    data filtering in the email client itself.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT integrate with your operating system, i.e. every
    application has to be <a href="browser.html">configured</a> separately for
    it.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT accelerate Internet access. When surfing with premium
    services you probably won't notice any big loss in speed though.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT JonDonym. JonDonym summarizes all the accessible services in
    JonDo in one term and describes the technology itself.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT JonDos. JonDos is the company that develops most of
  JonDo.</li>
  <li>JonDo can NOT use random "anonymous" proxies (e.g. those on lists of open
    proxies) to create an anonymous connection. This would be a totally <a
    href="otherServices.html#networkproxies">unsafe method</a> that does not
    lead to anonymization.</li>
  <li>JonDo filters No plugins, scripts or HTTPS websites. To secure your
    browser as a whole you best use <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox.</a></li>
  <li>JonDo is NO One-Click-Anonymization-Tool - something like that can and
    will not really ever exist! Prudence is and remains maxim for Internet
    security.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <!--<li>FTP, Telnet, SSH,... </li>-->
