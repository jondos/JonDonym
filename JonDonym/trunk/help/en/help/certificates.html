<h2>JonDonym certificates and their meaning</h2>

<p>Certificates are used to identify operators of JonDonym services.
Typically, a mix cascade consists of two or more consecutive mix servers
operated by different organizations. Only if all of these operators cooperate
could the anonymity of users be revoked. Users of JonDo should consider for
themselves whether they trust the operators of a cascade and whether they
connect to the service. It is therefore crucial that</p>
<ul>
  <li>the individual mixes are run by independent organizations and that </li>
  <li>the information about these organizations is reliable. </li>
</ul>

<p>Certificates are part of the so-called cryptographic public key method:
the organization identified by a certificate owns a private key that it uses
to create digital signatures. This key must always be kept secret since
everyone could otherwise use it to create signatures. By comparision to the
openly available public key others can check these signatures and verify that
they really communicate with the requested organization. The correlation of
identity and public key is proven by a <em>digital certificate</em>. This is
an electronic document digitally signed by a certification authority. It is
highly recommended to inspect the certificates of each individual server of a
mix cascade (click on the different mix icons and then on the respective
certificate). </p>

<h3>Certification authorities </h3>

<p>The JonDonym service may be compromised by the operator if a mix cascade
is only nominally run by different operators, while in fact all mixes are
under the control of a single organization. Trustworthy certification
authorities (CAs) should ensure that operators with different names really
are independent entities. Without an identity check by one of these
authorities mixes are useless for JonDo. But in the end, you will also have
to trust the certification authorities themselves, as they could in theory
invent non-existent operators and thereby run mixes under false flag. </p>

<p>In JonDonym, there currently are only two root certification authorities
(<a href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a> and <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/index_en.html">TU Dresden JAP Team</a>),
and they have committed themselves to be very careful when certifying
operators. Moreover, the certification of mix operators may also be done by
so-called Sub-CAs, whose identity has been confirmed by the root CAs and who
may perform their own certification processes. Sub-CAs are needed if the
identity of operators known to the Sub-CA can not be confirmed by the root CA
beyond doubt while such operators shall nevertheless not be excluded from the
JonDonym system. In the end, the user himself will have to decide whether he
wants to trust the Sub-CAs or not.</p>

<p>In the future, it is <a
href="http://www.jondos.de/en/development">planned</a> to perform
multi-party-certification. By then at least two certification authorities
will be needed in order to issue a trustworthy certificate. Thus, there will
no longer be the need to trust any single certification authority. With three
or more certification authorities, even if the secret certificate of a
certification authority gets lost or is invalid in any way, all other
certificates may remain valid.</p>

<h3>Mix certificates and operator certificates</h3>

<p>Both mixes and operators of mixes receive certificates. A CA issues an
operator certificates that are attached to its identity. An operator may then
generate as many mix certificates as he likes with his certificate. These
mixes, or mix certificates respectively, can then be associated with their
operators beyond a doubt. But it also means that information about the
location of mixes is in the end certified by an operator himself and is
therefore not as reliable as the information about the operator himself.</p>

<h3>Statuses of certificates </h3>

<p>A certificate is considered as <strong>verified</strong> only if you trust
the certification authority who has issued this certificate. Non-verifiable
certificates are generally <strong>not trusted</strong> as anyone who knows a
little about computer technology can generate such certificates by himself.
The <strong>validity</strong> of a certificate depends on the time period for
which the certificate has been issued. Typically, you should not trust an
<strong>expired</strong> certificate any longer, as it is not clear whether
the owner still has the right to offer the service. Certificates may also be
<strong>revoked</strong>, for example if their encryption was broken, the
operator turned out to be dubious or if the private certificate got into the
hands of unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>JonDo does not permit connections to mix cascades with at least one
<em>untrusted</em> mix at the moment. Expired or revoked certificates are
currently ignored, but are displayed as such. We are currently also
implementing a cascade filter with a better scalability.</p>
