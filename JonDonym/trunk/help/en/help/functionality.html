<H2>Functionality - in a nutshell </H2>
<h3>What JonDo is NOT</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo does NOT hide the IP address of your computer (!) </li>
  <li>JonDo is NO anonymisation tool for filesharing </li>
  <li>JonDo CANNOT anonymise E-Mails (except for web mailers)</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT integrate transparently into your system, but has to be <a href="browser.html">configured</a> separately for each anonymised application</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT accelerate your web access </li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT JonDonym (JonDonym is the service provided, JonDo is the client application for accessing this service)</li>
  <li>JonDo CANNOT use arbitrary &quot;anonymous&quot; proxies (for example from lists of open proxies) to establish an anonymous connection. This does only work with JonDonym Mix Cascades, that are <a href="certificates.html">certified</a>, automatically listed in JonDo and do not need to be entered manually. </li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT periodically change its IP address, but keeps the same IP address as long as it is connected to the same Mix Cascade. This may last minutes, hours or even days.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NO One-Click-Anonymisation tool - something like that does and will not really exist! Caution in internet security remains important.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT filter out scripts and browser information. <a href="noactive.html">Plugins like Flash/Shockwave/Java</a> have to be disabled in your browser in order to make anonymisation possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What JonDo is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo is an application for conceiling the own IP address when accessing the web with anonymised applications (<a href="supportedPrograms.html">HTTP, FTP-Downloads</a>)</li>
  <li>JonDo is an <a href="forwarding_client.html">anti-censorship application</a> that enables access to otherwise blocked websites. JonDonauts may moreover configure their JonDo for <a href="forwarding_server.html">forwarding (Fowarding-Server)</a> in order to allow other users the access the JonDonym service. </li>  
  <li>JonDo is open source </li>
  <li>JonDo is free of charge </li>
  <li>JonDo is available for virtually all operating systems </li>
  <li>JonDo may be used and modified by everyone for commercial on non-commercial operation for free</li>
  <li>JonDo was and is enhanced and developed by the <a href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a> in cooperation with german universities (<a href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, <a href="http://www-sec.uni-regensburg.de">Universit&auml;t Regensburg</a>) and privacy protection organisations (<a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">Independe</a><a href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de" target="_blank">nt Centre for Privacy Protection  Schleswig-Holstein</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What JonDonym is </h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDonym is the term for the anonymiser service that JonDo connects to</li>
  <li>JonDonym consists of many Mix Cascades of different length (2-4 Mixes) with different and independent Organisations as operators of the individual Mixes, respective</li>
  <li>An umbrella organisation (<a href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a>) independent from the operators guards the reliability of the individual operator organisations and develops the software.</li>
  <li>JonDonym is partially operated with costs for the users in order to finance enhancements of the software, the preservation of the umbrella organisation and the costs for operating the servers</li>
</ul>
