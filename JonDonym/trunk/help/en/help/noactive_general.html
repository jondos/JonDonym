<H2>Avoid data trails on the internet: Usage of a filter proxy</H2>

Different Browsers offer different options of blocking active content. Sometimes there are useful extensions for that purpose, sometimes not.
<br>A more general approach is the use of a filter proxy which will work for every type of browser. Just like JonDo is between your browser and the internet, a filter proxy will be between JonDo and your browser to block unwanted content.
<P>We made guides for the following filter proxies:
<UL>
<LI><B><A href="noactive_proxomitron.html">Proxomitron <b>(recommended)</b></A></B><BR>ClosedSource, C (Windows, Linux via WINE), numerous settings, active development
<P>
<LI><B><A href="noactive_muffin.html">Muffin</A></B><BR>OpenSource, Java (all OS), basic settings, no further development
</UL>
Proxomitron will likely be first choice for the majority of users. Muffin is recommended for those that cannot run Proxomitron on their operating system.
<P>
<b>Note</b>: In case you restricted Java, JavaScript or Cookies in your browser settings, you should disable these restrictions if you want to manage them using the filter proxy. Example: If you specify trustworthy sites for Java in the filter proxy, Java would still not work on these because you disabled Java in your browser.
