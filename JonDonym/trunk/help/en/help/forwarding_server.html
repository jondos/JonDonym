<h2>Forwarding server</h2>
<i>This panel is only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i>

<p>To get to this panel, press the button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main
window, then choose the entry <i>Forwarding Server</i> from the list to the
left.<br>
In this window, you can define how JonDo performs as a forwarding server.
With this function, other JonDo users who can not connect directly to the
anonymization service can still get a connection using your JonDo as an
access point. Please note, however, that there is a risk that you could be
suspected of a crime that another JonDo user commits if your system was used
as the forwarding system for that crime. </p>

<h3>Forwarding server settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Server port for forwarding</b><br>
    Enter the port number that your JonDo program uses for incoming
    forwarding connections. This port must be open for incoming connections
    in your firewall. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>My Internet connection</b><br>
    Select the type and speed of your internet connection. The value in the
    field "Max. bandwidth" is automatically set. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Percentage for forwarding</b><br>
    Choose a percentage from this field to set how much of your total
    upstream bandwidth should be used for forwarding. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Max. used bandwidth</b><br>
    The bandwidth actually used for forwarding based on the settings above is
    shown here. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Supported mix cascades</h3>
This section allows you to make changes to two settings. Either you allow all
clients that use your JonDo as a forwarding server to access all JonDo
cascades known ("Allow client access to all available mix cascades"), or you
only allow access to certain cascades. Cascade access is set with the buttons
"Add to allowed cascades" and "Remove from allowed cascades". Access is
allowed only for cascades found in the "Allowed mix cascades" list. 

<h3>InfoService registration</h3>
For JonDo users to find your JonDo forwarding server, your JonDo must be
registered as a forwarder with at least one InfoService. You can register at
all InfoServices or only at certain ones. The procedure is the same as for
supported mix cascades.<!--#include virtual="/footer_en.html"-->
