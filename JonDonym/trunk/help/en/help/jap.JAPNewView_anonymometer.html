<h2>The Anonym-O-Meter</h2>

<p>The Anonym-O-Meter displays visual information about the status and the
security of the selected service. Detailed information with more concrete data
can be reviewed at <a href="services.html">Details</a>.</p>

<table style="border-spacing:20px">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="jap.JAPNewView_meter10.gif" alt="connected"></td>
      <td>A picture similar to this shows that you are connected to an
        anonymization service. Both arrows measure the approximate level of
        anonymity offered by the active service. The left arrow measures the
        number and regional or international distribution of the servers and
        operators (optimum: at least three operators, operators and mixes in
        three different countries). The right arrow evaluates the number of
        active users on the service (optimum: at least 500 users). 

        <p>From this information a partially subjective risk of observation and
        a maximum level of anonymity can be deducted. The more active users
        sending and receiving packets there are the higher the level of
        anonymity for every single packet will be. That is because potentially
        every user could have been the source of the packet. The number and
        distribution of mix operators is also crucial: the more mixes there are
        in a cascade and the further they are spread across the globe, the less
        likely will it be that a user can be observed by an operator or third
        parties. Which value you should prefer depends on the potential
        observer that you want to protect yourself from.</p>
