<h2>Improvements to the security of AN.ON/JonDonym</h2>
With your help, we would like to examine how much our service is affected by so-called &#132intersection attacks&#147;. These may restrict the users&#39; anonymity and might have to be repeled by proper countermeasures.<br>
<br>
Your agreement for participation depends on an opt-in. This means that, after some connections to free anonymisation services (the premium services do not take part in the study), you will be asked whether you accept or decline participation.
If you once declined, you won&#39;t be asked any more. Moreover, you can withdraw your agreement at any time.<br>
<br>
If you agree to participate, then a random number will be generated.
Each time you connect to a free anonymisation service, this number will be transmitted to the
first Mix of this service, respective. We can use this number to explore how often a user connects and
disconnects. The study is performed until July 20th 2008.<br>
<br>
<b>Of course, your anonymity will be preserved at all times. No personal information will be transmitted.</b><br>
<br>
We would appreciate very much your assistance in improving the security of our anonymity service.
