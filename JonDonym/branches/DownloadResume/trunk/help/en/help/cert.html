<H2>Certificate Authorities</H2>
<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i><P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Certificate Authorities</i> from the list to the left.
<P> A certificate is a (digital) container for a public encryption key, digitally signed by a certification authority (e.g. the JonDo team), that approves for third parties by the signature that this key belongs to a given person or organisation. If this approval for certificates didn't exist, anyone could pretend to be the JonDo team or a trusted Mix operator, and may operate honypot Mixes, for example, or may engage in the communication between users and really trusted Mixes/operators and read all data.  Moreover, the insertion of faked update messages would be easy.
