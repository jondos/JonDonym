How to compile
==============

1. Prerequisites
----------------
You need: MS Visual Studio (any version starting from 6.0 should do)
1a. If you use the "Express" edition, then you need also a Windows Platform SDK
    Basically every platform SDK (which supports Windows 95) should do.
		Recommendation: Use the Vista SDK which could be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4377f86d-c913-4b5c-b87e-ef72e5b4e065&displaylang=en
		                You need only to install the "Vista headers and libraries"
										After installing you should execute the "Visual Studio Registration" from the "Microsoft Windows SDK" menu of the Windows startmenu
										
2. Loading the project file
---------------------------
Load the project /solution file according to your version of MS Visual Studio
  VC60 ---> Visual Studio 6.0  (not yet available)
	VC70 ---> Visual Studio 2002 (not yet available)
	VC71 ---> Visual Studio 2003 (not yet available)
	VC80 ---> Visual Studio 2005
  VC90 ---> Visual Studio 2008	
            Note: At the moment (beta2) Visual Studio 2008 can only generate .exe for operating systems greater then Win98. Therefore we need to patch the .exe file, so it will run also on Win95. This is done
						      by invoking "patchexe.exe" with the name of the .exe as commandline argument. This step will be automatically done then the 'release' version is compiled using Visual Stuido 2008.
	 
3. Compiling

3a. Compile the "Release" configuration to produce japdll.dll ready for release
