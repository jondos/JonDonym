<h2>JonDo User Interface: Iconified window</h2>
<center><img src="miniwindow.gif"></center>
<P>
JonDo's iconified window is a minimalistic view of JonDo's main window. You can invoce it by pressing <img src="miniwindow_button1.gif"> or by double-clicking anywhere into the main window. It shows only the most important information and consists of the following elements:
<UL>
	<LI><b>Bytes</b> This shows the amount of traffic that has been anonymized during this settion
	<LI><b>Anon</b> Shows the level of anonymity(low, fair, high)
	<LI><img src="miniwindow_icon.gif"> for toggling anonymity on or off
	<LI><img src="miniwindow_button2.gif"> button wich switches back to normal view (double-clicking the window will also do)
</UL>
Right-clicking on the window will open a menu which enables you, besides other actions, to view the currently used <a href="jap.JAPConfTrust.html">service filter</a> (boldface) and cascade, and to choose a new one.
