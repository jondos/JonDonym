    JonDo supports various forms of graphic appearance for the program windows and user interface elements.  Depending on the operating systems, several options are available.
    <UL>
		<LI><B>Select language</B><BR>
		Here you can change the language in which the user interface elements appear.<BR>
		Here, too, a restart of JonDo is needed for the changes to take effect.
		<P>
	  <LI><B>LookAndFeel</B><BR>
		Choose your preferred look and feel from the dropdown list. These changes require an instantaneous restart of JonDo to take effect.
		<BR>You may add new look and feel options by downloading some from the internet and importing them to JonDo.
		You need no packages created specifically for JonDo, instead you may use every look and feel package suitable for java.
		<BR>Such packages can be found at <A HREF="http://www.javootoo.com">www.javootoo.com</A>.
		After downloading a package, klick <i>Import</i> to add this look and feel.
		<UL>
			<LI><B>Delete</B><BR>
			This will delete the selected look and feel. You can only delete those you added by yourself. Deleting the currently active look and feel is also not possible. The deleted look and feel will remain in memory until a restart of JonDo is performed.
			<P>
			<LI><B>Import</B><BR>
			A click will open a file selection window. Navigate to the location of the newly downloaded look and feel package and choose the ".jar" file.
