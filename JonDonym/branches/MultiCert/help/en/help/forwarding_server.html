<h2>Forwarding server</h2>
<em class="jconf">This panel is only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>. To get to this panel,
press the button <code class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window,
then choose the entry <code class="jconf">Forwarding Server</code> from the
list to the left.</em><br>


<p>A forwarding server is used to bypass any blocking of access to JonDo
services. Because of censorship or other restrictive measures, a user may not
be allowed to connect directly to the anonymization service. This is why
JonDo includes the possibility of forwarding connections to the services. If
you would like your JonDo to also forward connections, you can find the
relevant settings in this window.</p>

<p>The option <code class="jconf">Forwarding Server ON</code> activates the
forwarding server. </p>

<p><b>Beware</b><br>
After activating forwarding, every JonDonym user can use your JonDo as an
access point to the services. You are exposing yourself to the risk of users
committing crimes on the Internet through your JonDo; however, you are still
well protected from discovery of your own IP address by the anonymization
services.</p>

<h3>Forwarding server settings</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Server port for forwarding</b><br>
    Enter the port number that your JonDo program uses for incoming
    forwarding connections. This port must be open for incoming connections
    in your firewall. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>My Internet connection</b><br>
    Select the type and speed of your internet connection. The value in the
    field <code class="jconf">Max. bandwidth</code> is automatically set by
    this. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Percentage for forwarding</b><br>
    Choose a percentage from this field to set how much of your total
    upstream bandwidth should be used for forwarding. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Max. used bandwidth</b><br>
    The bandwidth actually used for forwarding based on the settings above is
    shown here. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Allowed services</h3>
This section allows for basically two settings. Either you allow all
forwarded clients to access all JonDo services known (<code
class="jconf">Allow client access to all known services</code> is checked),
or you only allow access to certain services. Service access is set with the
buttons <code class="jconf">Add to allowed services</code> and <code
class="jconf">Remove from allowed services</code>. Access is allowed only to
services found in the <code class="jconf">Allowed Services</code> list. 

<h3>InfoService registration</h3>
For JonDo users to find your JonDo forwarding server, your JonDo must be
registered as a forwarder with at least one InfoService. You can register
with all InfoServices or only certain ones. The procedure is basically the
same as above.
