<h2>Alternative browser configuration</h2>

<p>For an optimal usage of <b>JonDo</b> we recommend also using <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. This will save you the configuration
effort, since <b>JonDoFox</b> already contains all necessary settings to surf
anonymously with <b>JonDo</b> on the Web. Further information about
<b>JonDoFox</b> may be found <a href="jondofox.html">here </a> or on the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/jondofox">JonDoFox homepage</a>. If you prefer
to use JonDonym with another browser it is necessary that you make the basic
settings yourself.</p>

<p><b>Please beware:</b><br>
False or incomplete configuration causes browsers to leave a lot of traces
while surfing, even if you use JonDonym. Configuring the browser yourself is
quite elaborate and requires a deeper understanding of web technologies.</p>

<h3>Proxy settings</h3>

<p>With proxy settings you configure your browser to not send requests
directly over the Internet but through JonDo instead. This anonymizes the
data. You will need to enter the following in the proxy settings for HTTP,
HTTPS, FTP, and if required GOPHER proxies of your browser:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hostname/IP address: <i><b>127.0.0.1</b></i></li>
  <li>Port: <i><b>4001</b></i> (<b>Attention</b>: If you have setup a
    different <a href="net.html">listen port</a> than <i>4001</i> in JonDo
    you need to input it here instead of <i>4001</i> too.)</li>
</ul>

<p><!--<br>Please remember that such exceptions can be made more flexibly in a filter-proxy 
like <a href="noactive_proxomitron.html">Proxomitron.</a><BR><BR>
<BR>-->
For some browsers there are step-by-step tutorials available:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="browser_ie.html">Internet Explorer</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_firefox2.html">Mozilla Firefox</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_opera.html">Opera</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_konqueror.html">Konqueror</a></li>
  <li><a href="browser_safari.html">Safari</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, please check your browser settings with the <a
href="security_test.html">browser security test</a>.</p>

<h3>Avoiding data traces</h3>

<p>Websites can offer special (active) content that can reveal your identity
or even damage your PC, although you seem to be surfing anonymously with
JonDo. This can happen by JavaScript, Java, Flash, Silverlight and Active
Scripting. Basically, every type of dynamic webcontent that is run on the PC
of the web surfer is potentially dangerous. Most browsers offer the
possibility of blocking such content but are usually quite inflexible at it,
so that the type of content can either be flatly denied or flatly allowed.
This is problematic though since some web applications will then only be
usable again after editing the configuration: e.g. chat rooms, Flash menus
and animations, or online games. At the same time, these changes will also
compromise security when surfing on other websites that do not require active
content at all. Depending on the browser in use, it may be very complicated
to completely deactivate active content in the configuration. Most of the
time, this will only be possible to experienced computer users. Therefore,
user-friendly and flexible settings, just as in <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>, are a great convenience. </p>

<p>Moreover, the browser sends so-called HTTP headers. They aid communication
with the web server in loading pages or using web services. But they can also
be used to identify you or create a profile of what your doing on the Net.
From the HTTP header the browser type may be obtained, furthermore the
language or the so-called <i>referer</i> which gives away your last visited
page. Also, the data contained in <a
href="wwwprivacy.html#cookies">cookies</a> is being send by HTTP headers.
Although JonDo filters these HTTP headers, for technical reasons it does so
only for unencrypted websites. If an eavesdropper should forward you to a
presumably secure HTTPS site you will again be left without filter
protection. The options for adapting HTTP headers are unfortunately very
limited in most browsers. For these reasons, we recommend relying on <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> since critical HTTP headers have been
preconfigured for maximum anonymity in it.</p>

<p>Much of the information your browser gives away can be reviewed in the <a
href="security_test.html">browser security test</a>.</p>
