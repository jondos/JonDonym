<h2>JonDo's features</h2>

<h3>JonDo - The Privacy Generator</h3>

<p>The program JonDo (a branch of <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">JAP</a>) allows your browser to contact
websites through an <a href="wwwprivacy.html#ip">IP address</a> within the <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a> system. This means that neither the
contacted server, nor any eavesdropper on your connections, nor the operators
of the JonDonym service themselves can realize which websites you surf. The
connection to <a href="jondonym.html#premiumservices">premium services</a>
allow for an additional anonymization of the following applications besides
browsers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>IRC Chat Clients (e.g. Chatzilla, integrated in <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>).</li>
  <li>Messengers (e.g. <a href="http://pidgin.im/download/">Pidgin</a>,
    recommend with the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> protocol
    and the <a href="http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/#downloads">OTR
    plugin</a>).</li>
  <li>And basically all programs for which you can configure a HTTP proxy and
    that do not give away your identity in their network protocols.</li>
</ul>

<p>Email clients and VoIP are currently not supported. To send anonymous
emails we recommend you dispense with email clients and resort to web based
mail services over the browser. Almost all email providers offer such webmail
access.</p>

<h3>What JonDo is</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo is an application that spoofs your own IP for web access by
    anonymized applications (e.g. by the web browser).</li>
  <li>JonDo is an <a
    href="forwarding_client.html">Anti-Censorship-Application</a> that allows
    access to otherwise blocked Internet sites. "JonDonauts" may also
    configure their JonDo as a <a href="forwarding_server.html">forwarding
    server</a> in order to allow others access to the JonDonym service.</li>
  <li>JonDo is open source and free, but it offers access to free and paid
    (premium) services.</li>
  <li>JonDo filters and anonymizes HTTP headers - but only for unencrypted
    connections (not HTTPS).</li>
  <li>JonDo is available on all major systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux).</li>
  <li>JonDo was and is developed by the <a
    href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a> in cooperation with German
    universities (<a href="http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de">TU Dresden</a>, <a
    href="http://www-sec.uni-regensburg.de">Universit&auml;t Regensburg</a>)
    and privacy organizations (<a
    href="http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de">Unabh&auml;ngiges Landeszentrum
    f&uuml;r Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What JonDo is not</h3>
<ul>
  <li>JonDo does NOT make your router's IP invisible. Your IP address is
    assigned to you by your ISP, and it is inalterable by third parties. You
    need the IP for JonDo to successfully connect to anonymization services
    on the Internet. When using JonDo, you are surfing with servers (mixes)
    on the Internet that all have their own separate IP address. The websites
    accessed by you will only see this respective outgoing address and not
    yours.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT regularly change the outgoing IP address, but retains
    the same outgoing IP as long as it stays connected to the same mix
    cascade. This could be minutes, hours or even days. The IPs of JonDonym
    mixes are public anyways. Changing the outgoing IP would therefore not
    achieve additional security.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT hide the MAC address of your PC or router. The MAC
    address is used by your ISP to assign you your IP address in the first
    place, and it should not be visible on the Internet besides that
  anyhow.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT a filesharing anonymization tool. You may run certain P2P
    applications with JonDo, but you will not be able to upload data
  yourself.</li>
  <li>JonDo can NOT anonymize emails (except web based email services). This
    would require special data filtering in the email client.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT transparently integrate with your operating system, i.e.
    every application has to be <a href="browser.html">configured</a>
    separately for it.</li>
  <li>JonDo does NOT accelerate Internet access. When surfing with premium
    services you probably won't notice any loss in speed though.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT JonDonym. JonDonym summarizes all the accessible services
    in JonDo in one term and describes the technology itself.</li>
  <li>JonDo is NOT JonDos. JonDos is the company that develops most of
  JonDo.</li>
  <li>JonDo can NOT use random "anonymous" proxies (e.g. those on lists of
    open proxies) to create an anonymous connection. This would be a totally
    <a href="otherServices.html#networkproxies">unsafe method</a> that does
    not lead to actual anonymization.</li>
  <li>JonDo filters No plugins, scripts or HTTPS websites. To secure your
    browser as a whole you best use <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox.</a></li>
  <li>JonDo is NO One-Click-Anonymization-Tool - something like that can and
    will not really ever exist! Prudence is and remains maxim for Internet
    security.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <!--<li>FTP, Telnet, SSH,... </li>-->
</ul>
