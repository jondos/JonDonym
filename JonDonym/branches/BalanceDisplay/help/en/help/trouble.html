<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<b>Neither <a href="index.html">this help</a> nor JonDo's built-in assistant
(a button in the main window) were able to solve your problem?</b> 

<p>If so, then first of all please read the <a
href="http://www.jondos.de/en/faq">FAQ on our homepage</a>. </p>

<p><b>You could not find the answer to your question in the FAQ
either?</b></p>

<p>You have several possibilities to ask others about your problem. But be
sure to <strong>provide as much</strong> of the following information as you
can for otherwise you might not get a satisfying answer or even no answer at
all:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A detailed description of the error and the situation(s) in which it
    occurs. It will take much longer to solve the problem if you just tell us
    <i>it does not work</i>. </li>
  <li>The version of JonDo your are using (appears at the startup screen and
    when you click on "i" in the JonDo main window, in the upper row of the
    newly opened window). </li>
  <li>Your installed Java version(s).</li>
  <li>Name and version of your browser and operating system, and ideally
    information about installed service packs too. </li>
</ul>
In many cases, this information may be important also: 
<ul>
  <li>Do you have a desktop firewall? If yes, which one? </li>
  <li>Do you have an antivirus tool? If yes, which one? </li>
  <li>How you connect to the Internet (your ISP, whether you connect from a
    local network, an external firewall or a forced proxy). </li>
</ul>
If you are able to provide them, also the following information may be useful
in solving your problem: 
<ul>
  <li>Your transaction number if you did create an account, or the number of
    your pseudonymous account.</li>
  <li>The version of your japdll.dll (appears when you click on "i" in
    JonDo's main window). </li>
  <li>The set <a href="appearance.html">Look&amp;Feel</a> in JonDo. </li>
  <li>On demand: A copy of the <a href="debugging.html">error messages</a>
    displayed in the console. Please toggle all possible checkboxes in the
    <em>Debugging</em> area in <em>Settings</em> and set all the sliders to
    maximum. Then save the output to a file. Before sending the file you may
    want to remove any personal information such as the username from it.</li>
</ul>
It is an advantage to provide concrete and detailed information, so that you
can be given the best support possible. 

<p>You may post questions, suggestions or criticism to the </p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.jondos.de/en/uieforum?fid=3">JonDos
User Support Forum</a> (<a href="http://www.jondos.de/en/search/node/">search
function</a>)</p>
or alternatively to the 

<p align="center"><a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=13367"
target="_blank">old AN.ON User Support Forum</a> (<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/search/?group_id=13367&amp;type_of_search=forums&amp;forum_id=333031"
target="_blank">search function</a>)</p>

<p>where you will most likely be helped quickly. Be sure to use the
<strong>forum search function</strong> before starting a new thread. Most of
the questions have already been answered. If this is not the case for your
questions, please use a <strong>meaningful subject</strong> for your posting
and not something like <em>"Problems!"</em>. Please help other users (and us)
by answering questions in the forum too, if possible.</p>

<p>If your problem could not be solved by other users, you should directly
contact us via email:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="mailto:support@jondos.de">support@jondos.de</a>
</p>

<p>Answering questions will take a certain amount of time, so please be
patient. </p>
