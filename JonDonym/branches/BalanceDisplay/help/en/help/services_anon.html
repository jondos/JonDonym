<h2>AN.ON/JonDonym</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this panel, press the button <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry
<code class="jconf">Services</code> from the list to the left and open the
tab <code class="jconf">AN.ON/JonDonym</code>.</em></p>

<p>This settings panel offers following information or configuration of
access to the services:</p>

<h3><a name="filter">Filter</a></h3>

<p>Which services your JonDo connects to or displays is determined by a
service filter that can be adjusted by you. Depending on which filter you
choose, the list below will display services that match the criteria of the
filter. The following filters are available to you: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>All services</b><br>
    Displays all available services that are likely to offer sufficient
    bandwidth.</li>
  <li><p><b>Premium services</b><br>
    Displays only premium services that show good performance data.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Free services</b><br>
    Hides all services that are not free and unlikely to offer sufficient
    performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Own services </b><br>
    This filter shows only those services that you have <a
    href="#manuell">created yourself</a>. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With the help of <i><b>user defined filters</b></i> you can determine the
selection criteria yourself. This filter, in contrast to the predefined
filters, also offers the possibility of combining multiple criteria. Click
the button <b>Edit filter</b> to create your own filter. You can adjust the
following selection criteria to your needs: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Cascade length</b><br>
    Determine whether a single mix is acceptable or whether you only want to
    use mix cascades. </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    When using a single mix service, your privacy will only be protected if
    the respective operator is completely trustworthy. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Operator</b><br>
    Here you may decide if you would like to hide services because of the
    participation of a certain organization or individual as a mix operator.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Internationality</b><br>
    Determine how many different nations have to participate in the service.
    This includes the location of the mix operating organizations and also
    the geographic location of the servers themselves.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The more internationalization, the more secure the service should be
    esteemed. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Quality</b><br>
    Choose whether only <a href="jondonym.html#premium">premium</a>, only
    free or all services are displayed. </p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The quality of the premium services is superior to that of the free
    services in the important aspects security, speed and availability. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Speed and latency</b><br>
    Here you can set a minimum speed and a maximum latency that the service
    has to provide in order to meet your selection criteria.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After having adjusted all selection criteria to your likings, click <code
class="jconf">Accept</code> to activate your user defined filter. With <code
class="jconf">Abort</code> you can revert your settings. </p>

<p><b>Blocking single services</b></p>

<p>The checkboxes to the left of the service entries are checked at default
for all available services. Unchecking a box causes JonDo to no longer
connect to this service. This achieves even more detailed filtering of
services than is already possible with the user defined service filters.</p>

<h3><a name="serviceinfos">Information about the available services</a></h3>

<p>You can receive very detailed information about the different services.
When hovering with your mouse over an entry in the selection list below the
service filter you will be shown the address of the first mix and its access
ports. To the right of the list you will furthermore be shown the following
information about the selected service: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Anonymity level</b><br>
    A value ranging from 0 to 10 measures the level of privacy that can be
    achieved with the current service. This value depends on the current
    number of connected users, the length of the cascade and its
    internationality (<a href="jap.JAPNewView_anonymometer.html">see
    Anonym-O-Meter</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>User count</b><br>
    The value displays the current number of users connected to the service.
    The higher the user count, the higher your privacy will be while using
    the service. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Speed</b><br>
    Displays the speed with which data is send and received in the cascade.
    The value is measured by the InfoServices and is calculated across all
    measurements from within the last hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Response time</b><br>
    Displays the time that passes between sending a data packet and receiving
    the response data. The value is measured by the InfoServices and is
    calculated across all measurements from within the last hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Availability</b><br>
    You can recognize from this information how reliable and stable the
    selected service works. The value is measured by the InfoServices and is
    calculated across all measurements from within the last hour.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The data is further concretized in the lower part of the window. For every
mix of the selected service a symbol will be shown. You can tell the number
of mixes in a cascade from it. The flag symbols to the right of the mix
symbols indicate the nationality of the mix operator (upper flag) and the
geographic location of the mix (lower flag). If there is only one flag next
to the mix symbol it means that the operator and the mix are located in the
same country. </p>

<p>Click a mix symbol to receive the following information about the
respective mix: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Position</b><br>
    The position which the selected mix has in the service. For detailed
    explanation click the text next to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Operator</b><br>
    The name of the organization that operates the selected mix. If you hover
    over the operator's name with your mouse you will be displayed the URL of
    the operator. A click on the text opens the homepage of the operator. The
    flag symbol to the left depicts the country in which the mix operator is
    located. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Email</b><br>
    The email address belongs to the person of contact of the selected
    server. A click on it opens your email client with the address of the
    operator. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Location</b><br>
    The geographic location of the server is shown here. A click on it opens
    a map. The flag symbol to the left shows at a glance in which country the
    mix is located. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Certificate</b><br>
    Here you can see whether the certificate of the server could be verified,
    whether it is still valid or has already expired. With a click on it you
    can explore the certificate even further. (<a
    href="certificates.html">further information about certificates...</a>)
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
