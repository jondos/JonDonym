This document shortly describes how to setup and run an InfoService-Server.

1. Compile the source code
2. Generate a key pair. This key pair is used as the "digital identity" of your InfoService.
To generate your key pair start the InfoService with the option "--generatekey":

  java -jar InfoService.jar --generatekey

You will be asked for a name of your InfoService (select a human read- and understandable one) and
for a password to protect your secret key.

3. Change the file "InfoService.properties":
  - Set "HardwareListeners" and "VirtualListeners" to the IP and Port (6543 is some kind of 'standard')
  your InfoService will listen on, e.g. if the IP of your server is 1.2.3.4 this would become:

    HardwareListeners=1.2.3.4:6543
    VirtualListeners=1.2.3.4:6543

  - Set "ownname" to the one you chose during creation of your key pair

 4. Start your InfoService:

   java -jar InfoService

   You can look at "InfoService.log" to see what happend...

 5. Test your InfoService with your favorite browser:
