<h3>Tor versus JonDonym</h3>

<p>On this page you can find information and settings concerning access to
the <a href="http://tor.eff.org">Tor anonymization network</a>. Since the
advantages and disadvantages of Tor versus JonDonym are a point of interest
to many users, we will do a small comparison of both services here.</p>

<p>Tor is an anonymization service that uses a method called <b>Onion
Routing</b>, whereas JonDonym/AN.ON are based on the <b>Mix Method</b> . Both
methods are very similar when it comes to the cryptographic processing of the
data (multiple encapsulated encryption), but they differ in how the data gets
relayed to the receiver. While in Onion Routing the actual way that the data
packets take through the anonymization network changes quite often, in a Mix
Method it is fixed. This is supposed to better spread the traffic load to
multiple onion routers, while a mix service transfers all the traffic load to
only a few intermediaries, the so-called mixes. The Tor network consists of a
multitude of onion routers, the so-called Tor nodes. The individual Tor node
does not have to fulfill high standards concerning network connection, memory
and computing capacity since the whole load is spread across the Tor network.
Compared to that, JonDonym only comprises a few mixes that are connected in
fixed mix cascades. These few mixes have to carry the whole traffic load. The
mixes therefore need substantially more resources than Tor nodes, and the
operation of a mix means significantly more effort and cost. </p>

<p>Because of this difference many users notice the following thing: while in
Tor the IP address changes with every new route as the last Tor node changes
too, it remains the same for a long period of time in JonDonym, as one
usually remains connected to the same cascade for a long period of time. From
there many users draw an incorrect conclusion: "The more often my IP changes,
the better my security will be." But in fact, changing an IP does not bring
about better protection from traffic analysis. What matters is only that the
visible IP can not be traced back to the original IP. Through multiple
encryption of data both, JonDonym and Tor, offer strong unlinkability, no
matter whether the visible IP changes often or not. </p>

<p>The discussion about which of the two methods is "better" is heavy and has
not brought about any definitive result yet. It is known that mix services
lead the score when it comes to security with respect to the organization of
the service. Tor is susceptible to <i>internal attackers</i>, i.e. an
operator of a Tor node could not be trustworthy and conduct attacks himself.
Still, both Tor and JonDonym consider this scenario since in both cases a
single trustworthy mix or tor node will suffice to guarantee the security of
the users. However, a manageable number of mix operators also makes it easier
to control them, bind them to contracts and to sanction them if a contractual
obligation has been failed. In JonDonym it is basically organized this way.
Tor on the other hand offers the possibility of operating your own Tor node
and expanding the Tor network to any Internet user without having to fulfill
such terms or even whole contracts. A Tor user can thus not readily assess
whether his data is sent through trustworthy intermediaries. Therefore, Tor
is not suitable for commercial use and can not give as many guarantees as
JonDonym can with respect to security and speed. </p>

<h3>Access to the Tor network with JonDo</h3>
JonDo has Tor support, but it is experimental. This is why we do not
guarantee complete or flawless functionality. If you would like to use JonDo
to access the Tor network, you will need to enter JonDo as a SOCKS (not as a
HTTP/HTTPS) proxy in your browser. 
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Activate</b><br>
    Using Tor with JonDo is still experimental. Deactivating this checkbox
    will result in prevention of accidental usage of Tor as well as less
    memory usage by JonDo. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Available Tor nodes</b><br>
    This tab shows systems that are a part of the Tor network and offer a
    connection to the Tor network. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Reload</b><br>
    This button reloads an updated list of currently accessible Tor nodes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Preferences for anonymous routing</b><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Minimum nodes per connection</b><br>
        Here you can set the minimum number of Tor nodes through which a
        connection should be routed before being sent to the destination
        computer. The more nodes you use, the more effective the
        anonymization of the connection will be. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Maximum nodes per connection</b><br>
        This slider sets the maximum number of Tor nodes used for a
        connection. The larger this number, the slower the connection will
        be. </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Change route every x connections</b><br>
        Here you can set how often a new route should be established.
        Whenever the threshold of connections has been reached, the old route
        is discarded and a new route through the Tor network is established.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Create anonymous route at startup</b><br>
        If this box is checked, JonDo automatically establishes a route
        through the Tor network at startup. If unchecked, a route is not
        established until a connection is demanded for the first time.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
