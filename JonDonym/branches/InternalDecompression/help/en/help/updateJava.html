<h2>Updating JRE (Java Runtime Environment) </h2>

<p><em>Notice: Users of Mac OS X will have their Java updated automatically
by the operating system and do not have to update manually. The following
information is not relevant to them.</em></p>

<p>JonDo is written in the Java programing language and therefore needs <a
href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> installed for execution. Please remember
that JAP/JonDo is at the moment only compatible with the Java distributions
<a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun-Java</a> and <a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/" target="_blank">OpenJDK</a>.</p>

<p>If you use a browser other than <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>, your
Java will usually be integrated as a plugin in your web browser. This is not
necessary for JonDo but it also enables your browser to execute Java web
applications (applets) which may <a href="wwwprivacy.html#active">revoke your
anonymity</a>. This is why we recommend deactivating or filtering this plugin
in your browser. Furthermore, also in this plugin, just as in every software,
new errors are discovered from time to time that may compromise the security
on the PC where it is installed. JonDo thus informs you when new Java
versions are available, and we recommend urgently to update right away. </p>

<p>Although Java supports simultaneous installations of different versions,
you should have only <a
href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102557-1">ONE
Java version installed on your computer</a>. Therefore uninstall all old
versions of this software before the new installation. </p>

<p><em>Notice: The following manual is only meant for Windows. In Linux
installation is specific to the distribution. The latest Java version may not
be compatible with every Linux distribution.</em></p>

<p>In order to update your Java installation, follow these three steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><p><b>Download the latest version</b><br>
    Get the current version from <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">this site</a> (<a
    href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/previous.jsp"
    target="_blank">alternatively from this site for older Windows
    versions;</a> please note that Sun-Java versions since 1.4 do not run on
    Windows 95).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Uninstall old version</b><br>
    Go to the start menu, open "Settings", "Control Panel" and choose "Add or
    Remove Programs". It might take a while until the list of installed
    software shows up. Choose the entry "J2SE Runtime Environment &lt;version
    number&gt;" and click "Uninstall". Wait for the uninstaller to complete.
    Perhaps you will have to restart your PC. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Install new Version</b><br>
    Double-click the installer you downloaded in step 1). Follow the
    installation instructions. Installation might take some time. Perhaps you
    will have to restart your PC.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
