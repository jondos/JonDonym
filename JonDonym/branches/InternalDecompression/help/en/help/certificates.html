<h2>JonDonym certificates and their meaning</h2>

<p>Certificates are used to identify operators of JonDonym services. Typically,
a mix cascade consists of two or more consecutive mix servers operated by
different organizations. Only if all of these operators cooperate could the
anonymity of the users be revoked. Users of JonDo should therefore consider for
themselves whether they trust the mix operators of a cascade and whether they
connect to this cascade according to this decision. It is therefore crucial
that</p>
<ul>
  <li>the individual mixes are run by independent organizations and that </li>
  <li>the information about these organizations is reliable. </li>
</ul>

<p>Certificates are parts of the so-called cryptographic public key method: the
organization identified by a certificate owns a private key that it uses to
create digital signatures. This key must always be kept secret since everyone
could otherwise use it to create signatures. By comparision to the openly
available public key others can check these signatures and verify that they
really communicate with the requested organization. The correlation of identity
and public key is proven by a <em>digital certificate</em>. This is an
electronic document digitally signed by a certification authority. It is highly
recommended to inspect the certificates of each individual server of a mix
cascade (click on the different mix icons and then on the respective
certificate). </p>

<h3>Certification authorities (CAs)</h3>

<p>Organisations that issue certificates are called certification authorities.
They connect the identity of the certificate owner to his public key using an
electronic signature. The <a href="cert.html">organisations issuing JonDonym
certificates</a> have committed themselves to be very careful when certifying
operators. Operators may also get certified by more than one CA. Multiple
certification takes the need for trusting a single certification authority.</p>

<h3>Mix certificates and operator certificates</h3>

<p>Both mixes and operators of mixes receive certificates. A CA issues an
operator certificate that is attached to his/her identity. By using this
certificate, the operator may then generate mix certificates him/herself for
his/her mixes . These mixes, or mix certificates respectively, can then be
associated with their operator beyond a doubt and cannot refer to a faked
identity.</p>

<h3><a name="status" id="status">Certification status</a></h3>

<p>A certificate is considered as <strong>verified</strong>&#xa0;<img alt=""
src="img/certs/trusted_black.png">only if you trust the certification authority
who has issued this certificate. Certificates may also be <strong>verified by
two</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/trusted_blue.png">, <strong>three
or more</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/trusted_green.png">
independent certification authorities at once. Thus, the correctness of the
identity and the reliability of the respective operator is better secured.
Non-verifiable certificates are generally <strong>not
trusted</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/not_trusted.png"> as anyone
with basic knowledge about computer technology can generate such certificates
by himself. The <strong>validity</strong> of a certificate depends on the time
period for which the certificate has been issued. Typically, you should not
trust an <strong>expired / invalid</strong>&#xa0;<img alt=""
src="img/certs/invalid.png"> certificate any longer, as it is not clear whether
the owner still has the right to offer the service. Certificates may also be
<strong>revoked</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/not_trusted.png">, for
example if their encryption was broken, the operator turned out to be dubious
or if the private certificate got into the hands of unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>JonDo blocks connections to mix cascades with at least one
<em>untrusted</em> or <em>revoked</em> mix. <em>Expired</em> certificates cause
<a href="services_anon.html">service filters</a> and the <a
href="jap.JAPNewView_anonymometer.html">Anonym-O-Meter</a> not to count such a
mix as part of the service. However, a connection to the service is still
possible if at least the first or the last mix in the service is still fully
trusted. Moreover, JonDo prevents connections to InfoServices with untrusted,
revoked or expired certificates. Program updates and payment connections are
also always checked for trusted certificates.</p>
