<H2>Proxy settings for browsers: Other Browsers</H2>

<p>JonDos suggests the preconfigured, portable <a href="http://www.jondos.de/en/jondofox">JonDoFox</a> for secure anonymous web browsing. It is availabe as complete browser (Windows) or as Firefox profile for all operating systems. </p>
<p>However, it's theoretically possible to set up JonDo for any web browser that supports surfing over an HTTP proxy.  You simply have to look in the settings menu of your browser for the possibility of configuring a proxy server and enter the following:
</p>
<UL>
	<LI> HTTP proxy address: 127.0.0.1
	<LI> HTTP proxy port: 4001
</UL>
You should be able to specify addresses where JonDo shall not be used somewhere around these settings.
<br>Please note that such exceptions can be managed in a more flexible way using <a href="noactive_proxomitron.html">Proxomitron</a>.
<BR>
<B>Note:</B> If you set a different <A HREF="portlistener.html">listener port</A> in JonDo, you'll have to enter this port here too, rather than 4001.
