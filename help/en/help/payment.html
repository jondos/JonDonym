<h2>Payment</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this settings panel click <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window and then choose <code
class="jconf">Payment</code> from the list to the left. <strong>Notice: This
dialog is not available in all versions of the program.</strong></em></p>

<p>In this dialog you can create new accounts for use with the <a
href="jondonym.html#premium">premium services</a>. You can administer your
existing accounts also.</p>

<h3>Accounts</h3>

<p>In this list you can see all the accounts that you have created. When you
access this dialog for the first time the list will be empty for no accounts
have been created yet.</p>

<p>Next to the list of accounts you will see the following information about
your account: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Creation date</b><br>
    The date on which you have created the account. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Valid until</b><br>
    The date on which the account expires. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Payment instance</b><br>
    The payment instance where you have registered your account. Below will
    be a link to the general terms and conditions of trade of the payment
    instance. <strong>Please remember that the GTCTs of the mix operators are
    valid self-supportingly.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If a message "no backup copy yet" is displayed next to the list then you
have not yet made a backup of the selected account. We recommend that you
<b>make a backup of every account to an external drive</b>. This will protect
your credit from data loss. By clicking either the message itself or the
button <a href="#saveaccount"><code class="jconf">Export</code></a> you can
save the selected account.</p>

<p>You can take the following actions: </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Create account </b><br>
    Lets you create a new account. The process of creating a new account may
    take a while because a complex cryptographic process has to be started.
    This is necessary for the process to be confidential and to ensure
    information integrity. During the creation process you may be asked a
    security question. The actual creation process depends on the method of
    payment that you have chosen. Please follow the instructions on-screen.
    When your account has been successfully created it will appear in the
    account list. </p>
    <p><b>IMPORTANT</b><br>
    Please <a href="#saveaccount">save your account</a> to an external drive
    after creation, e.g. an USB stick. It will protect you from data loss.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Transactions</b><br>
    Here you can view a list of the transactions for all the accounts. There
    can only be one transaction per account. You can delete an empty account
    that you have not paid for or that you have depleted anytime. You may
    also create one or more new accounts whenever you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Changing password</b><br>
    By clicking this button you can provide a new password for encrypting
    your account data. The password is valid for all of your accounts. <br>
    If you want to erase your password, click <code>Change password</code>
    and enter nothing as your new password.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Import</b><br>
    Here you can import a previously exported account.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information about the account balance</h3>

<p>In this section you can see all information available about the currently
selected account, and you can apply some actions too. You will be shown in
particular</p>
<ul>
  <li>the remaining volume on your selected account,</li>
  <li>the previous overall consumption and </li>
  <li>the amount that you have paid in.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can take the following actions:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Activate</b><br>
    With this button you can activate the selected account for connection to
    a premium service. The active account is emphasized. Password protected
    accounts can be unlocked by clicking this button and entering your
    password.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Reload</b><br>
    Fetches the current account balance from the payment instance.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Delete</b><br>
    Deletes your account.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>ATTENTION:</b> If there is any positive balance left on your
    account it will be <b>irretrievably lost</b> if you did not make a backup
    copy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b><a name="saveaccount">Export</a></b><br>
    This button saves the selected account data to a file. This is useful
    when you need to regain access to your account after a complete data loss
    or you have reinstalled JonDo or the whole OS. This is why you should
    copy the exported file to an external media (e.g. an USB stick).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced Settings</h3>

<p><i>To get to this settings panel click <code class="jconf">Settings</code>
at the JonDo main window, select the entry <code class="jconf">Payment</code>
from the list to the left and then open the tab <code class="jconf">Advanced
Settings</code>. This panel is only available in <a
href="../../de/help/appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i></p>
<ul>
  <!--
  <LI><B>Show confirm dialog before using a service with costs</B><BR>
  Activating this option will cause JonDo to display a confirmation dialog each time a service with costs is about to be used. This also means that JonDo will not be able to connect to a service with costs automatically during startup.
  <P>-->
  <li><p><b>Allow non-anonymous (direct) connections to payment
    instances</b><br>
    If activated, JonDo can get information about your account balance even
    if you have no anonymized connection at the moment.<br>
    If this option is deactivated, account information may be retrieved
    through an anonymized connection only.<br>
    It is recommended to activate this option so that accounts may be created
    or information may be retrieved anytime. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Show error messages from payment instance (deactivate for
    debugging only!)</b><br>
    If activated, error messages from the payment instance of the relevant
    service will be shown. It is recommended to do so. <i>This setting is
    only available in the beta version.</i> </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Automatically update account balance</b><br>
    If activated, JonDo will try to update your account balance at fixed
    intervals.<br>
    If you do not allow this, JonDo will not automatically show your current
    account balance. Your account will still be maintained correctly by the
    payment instance though. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Warning when closing JonDo while not all accounts have been saved
    </b><br>
    To prevent data loss, you may order JonDo to warn you if one or more of
    your accounts have not been backed up and JonDo is closing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Connection timeout</b><br>
    Sets the timeout for connections to the payment instance. If you
    experience problems creating or paying accounts, increasing the timeout
    may solve them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
