<H2>Proxy/Firewall</H2>

<P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Proxy/Firewall</i>.<br>
Some users cannot use the anonymity service directly.  This is the case if they are blocked by a firewall and thus cannot connect to the first mix.  Furthermore, some internet providers require an obligatory proxy.

<P>
If you are certain that you are forced to use an obligatory proxy, you can change the configuration of the proxy conection here.
