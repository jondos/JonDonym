<H2>Service filter </H2>

<i>This panel is currently being developed and is not yet reachable directly. Besides, the filter functionality described in the following text is already used in JonDo.</i>
<P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Service filter </i>from the list to the left.
<P>JonDo offers different services (Mix Cascades) to choose from. The settings in this panel enable you to filter these services regarding special criteria, and to block those from connection that do not correspond to these criteria. JonDo will only connect to a service if you set an adequate filter for it. You may change the current filter in the <a href="interface.html">main window</a> or in the <a href="jap.SystrayPopupMenu.html">context menu</a> by choosing any cascade you like in a filter. This filter will then be the active one. 
<P>The following filters are available at present:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Certified Mix Cascades</strong>: all available Mix cascades </li>
  <li> <strong>Mix Cascades with costs:</strong> Cascades that require payment to be used. Typically they are much faster, more stable and better reachable than cascades without costs. A lot of them consist of three different Mixes and are located internationally. Thus, they provide a maximum resistance against providers of the servers and against national surveillance efforts.</li>
  <li><strong>Mix Cascades without costs:</strong> Cascades that can be used for free. They provide a basic anonymity for Internet surfers who cannot afford to pay the service with costs, and should be reserved for them  (China, Iran, UAE, Tunisia,...). The typical surfing speed on these cascades is rather low. Moreover, services of this kind are often affected by ongoing outages, as the operators do  maintenance in their spare time only. </li>
</ul>
<P><em>Not all of these services provide an equal security, or are equally trustful. The security of a service depends on a lot of factors, but very important are the number and identity of the operators, and the location of Mixes. It is, for example, relatively easy to observe users that surf on a Mix Cascade that is controlled by a single operator only. In one of the next JonDo versions there consequently will be predefined and adaptable filters, that enhance the ability of users to make their choice according to the security of services</em>
