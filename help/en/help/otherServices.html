<h2>VPN services and Proxies</h2>

<h3>Additional safety with VPN services like Relakks, Steganos Anonym VPN,
Perfect Privacy, Cyber Ghost VPN, XeroBank VPN</h3>

<p>JonDonym and Tor may be the best anonymization systems technically, but both
share small disadvantages from concept that should be considered when using
them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browser plugins (Java/Flash/Silverlight/ActiveX) must be deactivated at
    the moment. Otherwise, your PC's/router's true IP can be revealed by a
    website.</li>
  <li>In principle, transfer speed will be clearly below ADSL capacity (maximum
    of 1-2 MBit/s possible). This is enough for surfing but maybe not for other
    scenarios such as huge downloads.</li>
  <li>Applications are not transparently anonymized but each has to be
    configured first (the <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox browser</a> is
    preconfigured though).</li>
  <li>Not all applications can be anonymized (HTTP/SOCKS proxies must be
    supported by the application).</li>
</ul>

<p>If JonDo is not compatible with a certain application, or if you wish for
less strong anonymization in favor of speed, it can be helpful to use a VPN
(Virtual Private Network) system at the side of JonDonym for an additional
layer of security. A VPN can at least offer limited protection to your IP
address if you use (unsigned) Java or Flash applets from time to time. But in
this case, you should take care that your computer is behind a router or
running in a virtual machine to protect against automated hacker attacks
through browser plugins. JonDos is preparing its own supplementary VPN offer
until the end of 2009, which will be integrated in JonDo as a combi-package.</p>

<p>For web surfing, except bigger downloads maybe, VPN services should not be
used. On one hand, their hosts usually do not ensure that users also have an
uniform appearance on the Web aside their IP address (<a
href="wwwprivacy.html">see last chapter</a>). The users are thus
distinguishable and easily identifiable by merging the data. And on the other
hand, a local observer on your network (ISP, WLAN) could guesstimate websites
requested over VPN quite well by analyzing size and timing of the encrypted VPN
data stream. JonDonym and Tor are quite resilient against this attack (a
scientific article which demonstrates the attack and lists experimental results
is in preparation; the success rates are over 90% for VPNs). You should also
keep in mind that VPN hosts can, unlike JonDonym and Tor, track and save every
step of yours since they control all servers in the VPN. Nevertheless,
protection by the VPN of a professional and reputable host is most of the time
better than no protection at all. </p>

<h3><a name="networkproxies" id="networkproxies">Network proxies and web
proxies</a></h3>

<p>Proxy services are particularly famous for this kind of "anonymization on
demand", besides the already mentioned services. Proxies are literally proxy
PCs which take upon communication between your PC and the Internet, relay it to
the target and send the answer back to your PC. Huge lists of the so-called
network proxies or "anonymous" proxies are offered for free download on the
Internet and can be entered in most browsers without much of a hassle. Some
software providers distribute programs with which these lists can be updated
automatically. In addition to these proxies, there are webproxy services,
Internet pages with a form field, in which the user can input the target
address that he want's to visit anonymously. The webproxy subsequently delivers
the content of the requested website and automatically patches all links to use
the webproxy when clicked. For using webproxy services the browser
configuration does not have to be changed.</p>

<p>Apart from compatibility problems of webproxies with JavaScript (JavaScript
URLs can often not be substituted correctly), proxies are commonly unsafe: many
proxies are PCs hijacked by hackers or criminals. Some give your IP away to the
target webserver. Connections with proxies are almost always unencrypted, so
that an eavesdropper on your connection could observe your surfing behavior.
Moreover, the proxy operator can, of course, watch exactly what you are doing.
Proxies offer thus, if at all, only some protection from the website's host but
not from third parties.</p>

<h3>Local proxies</h3>

<p>The program JonDo works as a local proxy directly on your PC. Just as with
normal proxies your browser (or other applications on your PC configured for
JonDo resp.) has to connect to it in order to access the Internet indirectly.
But since JonDo runs on your own PC, instead of on a third party server, it is
not affected by the generic proxy security flaws mentioned above. JonDo itself
relays communication of your configured Internet applications over a
multi-encrypted, direct TCP connection to a <a href="jondonym.html">JonDonym
mix cascade</a>.</p>
