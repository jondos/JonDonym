<h2>VPN services and Proxies</h2>

<h3>Additional safety with VPN services like Relakks, Steganos Anonym VPN,
Perfect Privacy, Cyber Ghost VPN, XeroBank VPN</h3>

<p>JonDonym and Tor may be the best anonymization systems technically, but
both share small disadvantages from concept that should be considered when
using them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Browser plugins (Java/Flash/Silverlight/ActiveX) must be deactivated at
    the moment. Otherwise, your PC's/router's true IP can be revealed by a
    website.</li>
  <li>In principle, transfer speed will be clearly below ADSL capacity
    (maximum of 1-2 MBit/s possible). This is enough for surfing but maybe
    not for other scenarios such as huge downloads.</li>
  <li>Applications are not transparently anonymized but each has to be
    configured first (the <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox browser</a> is
    preconfigured though).</li>
  <li>Not all applications can be anonymized (HTTP/SOCKS proxies must be
    supported by the application).</li>
</ul>

<p>If JonDo is not compatible with a certain application, or if you wish for
less strong anonymization in favor of speed, it can be helpful to use a VPN
(Virtual Private Network) system at the side of JonDonym for an additional
layer of security. A VPN can at least offer limited protection to your IP
address if you use (unsigned) Java or Flash applets from time to time. But in
this case, you should take care that your computer is behind a router or
running in a virtual machine to protect against automated hacker attacks
through browser plugins. JonDos is preparing its own supplementary VPN offer
until the end of 2009, which will be integrated in JonDo as a
combi-package.</p>

<p>For web surfing, except bigger downloads maybe, VPN services should not be
used. On one hand, their hosts usually do not ensure that users also have an
uniform appearance on the Web aside their IP address (<a
href="wwwprivacy.html">see last chapter</a>). The users are thus
distinguishable and easily identifiable by merging the data. And on the other
hand, a local observer on your network (ISP, WLAN) could guesstimate websites
requested over VPN quite well by analyzing size and timing of the encrypted
VPN data stream. JonDonym and Tor are quite resilient against this attack (a
scientific article which demonstrates the attack and lists experimental
results is in preparation; the success rates are over 90% for VPNs). You
should also keep in mind that VPN hosts can, unlike JonDonym and Tor, track
and save every step of yours since they control all servers in the VPN.
Nevertheless, protection by the VPN of a professional and reputable host is
most of the time better than no protection at all. </p>

<h3><a name="networkproxies" id="networkproxies">Network proxies and web proxies</a></h3>

<p>Proxy services are particularly famous for this kind of "anonymization on
demand", besides the already mentioned services. Proxies are literally proxy
PCs which take upon communication between your PC and the Internet, relay it
to the target and send the answer back to your PC. Huge lists of the
so-called network proxies or "anonymous" proxies are offered for free
download on the Internet and can be entered in most browsers without much of
a hassle. Some software providers distribute programs with which these lists
can be updated automatically. In addition to these proxies, there are
webproxy services, Internet pages with a form field, in which the user can
input the target address that he want's to visit anonymously. The webproxy
subsequently delivers the content of the requested website and automatically
patches all links to use the webproxy when clicked. For using webproxy
services the browser configuration does not have to be changed.</p>

<p>Apart from compatibility problems of webproxies with JavaScript
(JavaScript URLs can often not be substituted correctly), proxies are
commonly unsafe: many proxies are PCs hijacked by hackers or criminals. Some
give your IP away to the target webserver. Connections with proxies are
almost always unencrypted, so that an eavesdropper on your connection could
observe your surfing behavior. Moreover, the proxy operator can, of course,
watch exactly what you are doing. Proxies offer thus, if at all, only some
protection from the website's host but not from third parties.</p>

<h3>Local proxies</h3>

<p>The program JonDo works as a local proxy directly on your PC. Just as with
normal proxies your browser (or other applications on your PC configured for
JonDo resp.) has to connect to it in order to access the Internet indirectly.
But since JonDo runs on your own PC, instead of on a third party server, it
is not affected by the generic proxy security flaws mentioned above. JonDo
itself relays communication of your configured Internet applications over a
multi-encrypted, direct TCP connection to a <a href="jondonym.html">JonDonym
mix cascade</a>.</p>
