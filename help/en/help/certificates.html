<h2>JonDonym certificates and their meaning</h2>

<p>Certificates are used to identify operators of JonDonym services. Typically,
a mix cascade consists of two or more consecutive mix servers operated by
different organizations. Only if all of these operators cooperate could the
anonymity of users be revoked. Users of JonDo should consider for themselves
whether they trust the operators of a cascade and whether they connect to the
service. It is therefore crucial that</p>
<ul>
  <li>the individual mixes are run by independent organizations and that </li>
  <li>the information about these organizations is reliable. </li>
</ul>

<p>Certificates are part of the so-called cryptographic public key method: the
organization identified by a certificate owns a private key that it uses to
create digital signatures. This key must always be kept secret since everyone
could otherwise use it to create signatures. By comparision to the openly
available public key others can check these signatures and verify that they
really communicate with the requested organization. The correlation of identity
and public key is proven by a <em>digital certificate</em>. This is an
electronic document digitally signed by a certification authority. It is highly
recommended to inspect the certificates of each individual server of a mix
cascade (click on the different mix icons and then on the respective
certificate). </p>

<h3>Certification authorities </h3>

<p>The JonDonym service may be compromised by the operator if a mix cascade is
only nominally run by different operators, while in fact all mixes are under
the control of a single organization. Trustworthy certification authorities
(CAs) should ensure that operators with different names really are independent
entities. Without an identity check by one of these authorities mixes are
useless for JonDo. But in the end, you will also have to trust the
certification authorities themselves, as they could in theory invent
non-existent operators and thereby run mixes under false flag. </p>

<p>In JonDonym, there are several root certification authorities (e.g. <a
href="http://www.jondos.de/en">JonDos GmbH</a> and <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/index_en.html">TU Dresden JAP Team</a>).
They have committed themselves to be very careful when certifying operators.
Operators may also get certified more than one CA. Such a multiple
certification takes the need for trusting a single certification authority.</p>

<h3>Mix certificates and operator certificates</h3>

<p>Both mixes and operators of mixes receive certificates. A CA issues an
operator certificates that are attached to its identity. An operator may then
generate as many mix certificates as he likes with his certificate. These
mixes, or mix certificates respectively, can then be associated with their
operators beyond a doubt. But it also means that information about the location
of mixes is in the end certified by an operator himself and is therefore not as
reliable as the information about the operator himself.</p>

<h3><a name="status" id="status">Certification status</a></h3>

<p>A certificate is considered as <strong>verified</strong>&#xa0;<img alt=""
src="img/certs/trusted_black.png">only if you trust the certification authority
who has issued this certificate. Certificates may also be <strong>verified by
two</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/trusted_blue.png">, <strong>three
or more</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/trusted_green.png">
independent certification authorities at once, which means a much higher
security that the identity and reliability of the respective operator was
correctly verified. Non-verifiable certificates are generally <strong>not
trusted</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/not_trusted.png"> as anyone
who knows a little about computer technology can generate such certificates by
himself. The <strong>validity</strong> of a certificate depends on the time
period for which the certificate has been issued. Typically, you should not
trust an <strong>expired / invalid</strong>&#xa0;<img alt=""
src="img/certs/invalid.png"> certificate any longer, as it is not clear whether
the owner still has the right to offer the service. Certificates may also be
<strong>revoked</strong>&#xa0;<img alt="" src="img/certs/not_trusted.png">, for
example if their encryption was broken, the operator turned out to be dubious
or if the private certificate got into the hands of unauthorized persons.</p>

<p>JonDo does not permit connections to mix cascades with at least one
<em>untrusted</em> or <em>revoked</em> mix. <em>Expired</em> certificates cause
<a href="services_anon.html">service filters</a> and the <a
href="jap.JAPNewView_anonymometer.html">Anonym-O-Meter</a> not to count such a
mix as part of the service. However, a connection to the service is still
possible if at least one mix in the service is still trusted. Moreover, JonDo
forbids connections to InfoServices with untrusted, revoked or expired
certificates, and checks program updates and payment connections for trusted
certificates.</p>
