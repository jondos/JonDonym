<h2>Certification Authorities</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">Only available in <a
href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert View</a>. To get to this panel,
press <code class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window, then choose
the entry <code class="jconf">Certification Authorities</code> from the list
to the left.</em></p>

<p>To ensure authenticity and integrity of digital data, secure digital
signatures are created from secret keys. The validity of such a signature can
be tested with the public key that corresponds to the secret key; just like a
key fits the proper lock. But capable proof is still needed that the key in
question belongs to a certain person or organization. </p>

<p>This is where <b>certificates</b> come in. A certificate is a (digital)
container of the identity of a person or organization and their the public
encryption keys. To obtain a capable proof of authenticity, the certificate
has then to be digitally signed by an authorized certification authority
whose keys are openly available.<br>

information about certificates...</a></p>

<p>Certificates play a key role in JonDonym: mixes prove their authenticity
to JonDo with them. Your JonDo already has all the needed certificates
included to ensure that it only connects to services of certified operators.
But with this settings panel you are also given the opportunity of adding
your own certificates and administering them in case you want to connect to
cascades that Jondo has no certificates of yet. </p>

<p><b>BEWARE</b><br>
Adding certificates is a very sensitive and security critical area. If you
accept certificates from untrustworthy certification authorities you run the
risk of damage by connecting to dubious services. So you should only add new
certificates if you really know what you are doing. It is not necessary
usually.</p>

<h3>Certification authorities</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>I only want to use servers certified by the following
    authorities</b><br>
    This list contains all certification authorities that you trust. If a
    server is not certified by a certifying body listed here JonDo will not
    connect to it. <strong>If you deactivate this option no verification of
    certificates will be conducted. Third parties may then lead JonDo to
    believe that they are secure services or they may falsify identities of
    the operators.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Import</b><br>
    With this button, you can add certification authorities to the list. The
    appropriate certificate has to be chosen in the dialog that appears. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Remove</b><br>
    This button removes the selected entry from the list. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Disable</b><br>
    By clicking this button, you can temporarily deactivate an entry without
    removing it from the list. The entry is flagged <code
    class="jconf">untrustworthy</code> and JonDo will no longer accept
    certificates issued by this certifying body. <strong>Under certain
    circumstances you can no longer connect to a service after having
    deactivated certificates from certifying bodies.</strong> 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Details...</b><br>
    Click this button to see the details of the selected certificate. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
