<H2>First Steps</H2>
<B>Surfing anonymously</B>

<P>
After successfully loading and starting the JonDo Anon Proxy, you will
have to take the following steps to be able to surf the web anonymously.

<UL>
    <LI>Connect your computer to the internet.
    <LI>Activate the anonymous connection using the JonDo <A HREF="interface.html">user interface</A>.
    <LI>Configure your browser to use JonDo as an HTTP proxy. Enter the
    following data into the proxy settings: <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host: <B>127.0.0.1</B> <BR>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port: <B>4001</B> <BR>
    A more <A HREF="browser.html">detailed description</A> can be found here.
</UL>

<P>
Now you can surf anonymously. For your protection, you should also deactivate
cookies in your browser. Otherwise, web server operators might be
able to reconstruct your surfing behavior by means of sending and receiving
cookies. As long as you do not reveal your identity directly, though, it is
not possible for the server to discover your identity.

<P>
<b>Note:</b> Once your browser's configuration has been changed, all web
connections go through JonDo. To surf anonymously, you have to start JonDo in addition to your browser
and activate the anonymous connection. If wish to no longer surf
anonymously, you must reset the proxy settings in your browser.
