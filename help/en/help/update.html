<h2>Updating</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this settings window press the button <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in the main window of JonDo, then choose the
entry <code class="jconf">Update</code> from the list to the left. This panel
is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert
View</a>.</em></p>

<p>In this dialog you can check whether new versions of JonDo are available for
patching.</p>

<h3>Installed Version</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Version</b><br>
    Here you can see the version number of JonDo. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Date</b><br>
    This field shows the release timestamp of the currently installed version.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Type</b><br>
    There are two possible versions: the <em>stable version</em> has been
    thoroughly tested. The <em>beta version</em>, also called <em>developer
    version</em>, includes all functions that are available at the moment, also
    those that are still undergoing testing. This is why the <em>beta
    version</em> is meant for experienced and curious users.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Version</h3>

<p>The information here does not refer to the software currently installed on
your system, but rather it refers to the JonDo version that can currently be
downloaded. Using the dropdown menu <code>Type</code>, you can choose whether
it applies to the <em>stable version</em> or the <em>beta version</em>.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Anonymous update connections</b></p>
    <p><em>Only if direct connection is not possible</em> makes JonDo connect
    to the update server through the currently active JonDonym service if the
    respective update server is not available through a direct connection. This
    could for example be the case if your ISP blocks access to the update
    server.</p>
    <p><em>Always (deny non-anonymous connection)</em> will result in update
    servers being contacted only through JonDonym services. <strong>By setting
    this, you may under circumstances no longer be able to receive updates. But
    on the other side you are protected against directed manipulation of the
    software by the creator for your installation can not be
    identified.</strong><em></em></p>
    <p><em>Never (allow direct connection only)</em> can make sense if you want
    to cut cost. For<strong>update data transmitted through premium JonDonym
    services will for compelling technical reasons be accounted for just like
    any other user data</strong>. This setting blocks any updates through the
    anonymous connection.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Show information window when a new JAP/JonDo version is
    available</b><br>
    If this option is active, an information window will be shown from which
    you can update directly whenever a new version of JonDo is available. If it
    is deactivated, the status bar of the main window will display only a small
    reminder. JonDo checks for new versions at startup and every 12 hours from
    then. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Show information window when new version of Java (JRE)is
    available</b><br>
    JonDo checks for new JAVA versions at startup and every 12 hours
    thereafter. If this option is active, an information window will be shown.
    Upgrading the JRE has to be done manually. <a
    href="updateJava.html">More...</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Info</h3>

<p>This field displays information about the update's installation progress.
Furthermore, it shows the results of checks for a new version.</p>

<h3>Other Elements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Check for new updates</b><br>
    Click this button to check if a newer version than the currently installed
    version is available for download. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Upgrade...</b><br>
    With this button, you can, depending on your selection for <a
    href="#type">Type</a>, download the latest version of JonDo from the
    Internet and install it on your system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
