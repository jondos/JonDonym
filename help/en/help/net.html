<h2>Network</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this panel, press <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> at the main interface and afterwards select
<code class="jconf">Network</code> from the list to the left.<br>
</em> </p>

<p>In this section you can configure all settings relevant to the network
connections of JonDo. </p>

<h3>Bypassing Internet censorship and filtering</h3>

<p>This function is necessary if you can not connect to the service, e.g.
because it is blocked by your company's firewall or by your Internet service
provider. <em>Please, only apply these settings if you can not connect
directly to the services. You will be reducing your bandwidth and the process
of connecting is made more difficult for no reason.</em> </p>

<p><b>Connecting to other JAP/JonDo users in order to reach a service</b></p>

<p>By activating this option you can connect to a service with somebody
else's JonDo, which acts as a <a href="forwarding_server.html">forwarding
server</a>.</p>

<h3>Listener port number</h3>

<p>For JonDo to protect your communication on the Internet it has to be
interposed between your browser and the Internet. Such a local intermediary
is called a <a href="otherServices.html#local">local proxy</a>. The following
settings are specific to the proxy functionality of the program. </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Port number</b><br>
    Enter your port number here at which JonDo will accept connections from
    your browser. Please remember that your browser's settings must be <a
    href="browser.html">adjusted</a> accordingly. <a
    href="jondofox.html"></a></p>
    <p><b>Notice</b><br>
    The port number is preset to 4001 in JonDo. We recommend keeping it since
    it is linked to many other settings, including <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>. Only change the port if you know just
    why you need to do it in your case. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Allow access to JAP/JonDo only from my PC</b><br>
    If this option is active only your own PC will be able to connect to your
    JonDo. </p>
    <p>If it is deactivated all PCs on the network or the Internet may
    connect to your JonDo. Unauthorized individuals may then abuse your JonDo
    for illegal purposes and also use the data volume you paid for it. As
    long a you do not have good reason to allow other PCs access, it is
    recommended to keep this setting activated for security reasons.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="fproxy">Compulsory proxy/firewall</a></h3>

<p>In some networks a connection to the Internet is only possible through the
company's or the ISP's proxy. If this is the case for you, you can edit the
settings needed for your JonDo to connect to the proxy here.</p>

<p><em>Hint: If you like, you can also enter a local Tor client here for an
additional layer of security. Your connection will be slower though.</em> </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>I have to use a "compulsory" proxy</b><br>
    Activate this option to tell JonDo that a proxy is needed for access to
    the Internet.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Type</b><br>
    Enter the type of proxy your using. Possible types are "SOCKS" or
    "HTTP/HTTPS". <em>For Tor enter "SOCKS" here.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Host</b><br>
    Enter the host name or the IP address of your proxy here. <em>For Tor
    enter "localhost".</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Port</b><br>
    Enter the port at which your proxy accepts connections. <em>For Tor enter
    9050.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Authorization needed for proxy</b><br>
    Select this field if you have to authorize with your proxy. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>User ID</b><br>
    Enter your username for accessing the proxy. The password will be asked
    for automatically upon the first connection attempt. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
