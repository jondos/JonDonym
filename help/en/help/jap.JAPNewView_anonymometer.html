<h2>The Anonym-O-Meter</h2>

<p>The Anonym-O-Meter displays visual information about the status and the
security of the selected service. Detailed information with more concrete data
can be reviewed at <a href="services.html">Details</a>.</p>

<p>From the information the Anonym-O-Meter gives, a partially subjective risk
of observation and a maximum level of anonymity can be deducted. The more
active users sending and receiving packets there are the higher the level of
anonymity for every single packet will be. That is because potentially every
user could have been the source of the packet. The number and distribution of
mix operators is also crucial: the more mixes there are in a cascade and the
further they are spread across the globe, the less likely will it be that a
user can be observed by an operator or third parties. Which value you should
prefer depends on the potential observer that you want to protect yourself
from. This evaluation provides, besides an informational function for the
users, also positive incentives for commercial mix operators to preferably form
secure cascades.</p>

      <td>A picture similar to this shows that you are connected to an
        anonymization service. The symbols measure the approximate level of
        anonymity offered by the active service. The left symbols (server
        icons) reflect the number of servers and operators. The colors of
        connections in-between describe the regional or international
        distribution of these servers. The more servers and the more colors you
        see, the better distributed this service is. (optimum: at least three
        operators, operators and mixes in three different countries = one blue
        and one green connection). The right symbol evaluates the number of
        active users on the service (optimum: at least 500). Those two values,
        distribution and users, are additionally reflected in two evaluation
        bars on the bottom: they turn more or less green according to the
        values (full green is optimum). In pure number represenation, both
        values range from 0 to 6, separated by commas (e.g. 5,4 / 6,6 - the two
        last values describe the theoretic maximum: first distribution, last
        users)</td>
