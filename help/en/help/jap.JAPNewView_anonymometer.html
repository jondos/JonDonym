<h2>The Anonym-O-Meter</h2>

<p>The Anonym-O-Meter displays visual information about the status and the
security of the selected service. Detailed information with more concrete
data can be reviewed at <a href="services.html">Details</a>.</p>

<table style="border-spacing:20px">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="jap.JAPNewView_meter10.gif" alt="connected"></td>
      <td>A picture similar to this shows that you are connected to an
        anonymization service. Both arrows measure the approximate level of
        anonymity offered by the active service. The left arrow measures the
        number and regional or international distribution of the servers and
        operators (optimum: at least three operators, operators and mixes in
        different countries). The right arrow evaluates the number of active
        users on the service (optimum: at least 500 users). 

        <p>From this information a partially subjective risk of observation
        and a maximum level of anonymity can be deducted. The more active
        users sending and receiving packets there are the higher the level of
        anonymity for every single packet will be. That is because
        potentially every user could have been the source of the packet. The
        number and distribution of mix operators is also crucial: the more
        mixes there are in a cascade and the further they are spread across
        the globe, the less likely will it be that a user can be observed by
        an operator or third parties. Which value you should prefer depends
        on the potential observer that you want to protect yourself from.</p>
