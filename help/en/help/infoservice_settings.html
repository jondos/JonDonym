<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i><P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>InfoService</i> from the list to the left, then open the tab <i>Settings</i>.<br>
The Info Service is used to provide JonDo with necessary information about
the anonymity service. At the moment this includes:

<UL>
    <LI> The current JonDo version number to allow automatic updates.
    <LI> The address of the first mix.
    <LI> Information on the mix cascade, e.g. the public keys of the
    mixes.
    <LI> Information on the service's capacity and the
     level of anonymity achieved by JonDo.
</UL>

Please note that the correct information for the InfoService is already set by default.  Changes to these settings could cause JonDo to no longer find the anonymization service.

<P>
