<h2>JonDoFox - Security and Privacy for Firefox </h2>

<p>JonDoFox is a <a
href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> browser profile
particularly optimised for anonymous surfing over <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ffprofile" id="ffprofile">Profile Installation</a></h3>

<p>If not done yet, install <a
href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/">Firefox</a> on your system
first. After that, you may install JonDoFox as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a name="ffpwindows"><b>Windows</b></a> 
    <p>Launch the <a
    href="https://www.jondos.de/downloads/JonDoFox.paf.exe">JonDoFox
    installation program</a>, choose "lite" oder "complete", and then follow
    the instructions.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ffpmacosx"><b>Mac OS X</b></a> 
    <ol>
      <li>Download the file <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X.dmg">JonDoFox_OS_X.dmg</a>
        (also available as <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_lite.dmg">Lite
        version</a> with only the security relevant extensions).</li>
      <li>Open the file by a double click. Then launch
        <em>JonDoFox_Install</em> with another double click.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><a name="ffplinux"><b>Linux</b></a> 
    <ol>
      <li>Download the file <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/profile.zip">profile.zip</a>
        (also available as <a
        href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/profile_lite.zip">Lite
        version</a> with only the security relevant extensions).</li>
      <li>Unpack the file, e.g. from command line using the command <code>unzip
        profile.zip</code>.</li>
      <li>Now start the the firefox profile manager from command line using the
        command <code>firefox -P</code>.</li>
      <li>Choose <i>Create profile</i> in the profile manager and click
        <em>Continue</em> afterwards.</li>
      <li>Insert the folder where you have unpacked the contents of the file
        <i>profile.zip</i> as profile folder. You are free to choose the
        profile's name.</li>
      <li>Click on <em>Finish</em> to complete installation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any "normal" Firefox configuration you may have previously created remains
untouched thereby. After installation, you may choose between both
configurations. When a new version of JonDoFox is released, you may always
install the new version "over" the old one, that is into the same directory.
You bookmarks will be kept. </p>

<h3>Portable installation for Windows (2000, XP, Vista)</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jondos.de/downloads/JonDoFox.paf.exe">JonDoFox
installation program</a> is also suitable for a "portable" installation. If you
choose the "for travelling" Installation, you may install JonDoFox on both a
removable drive and on you hard drive. Any existing Firefox or JonDoFox
installation on your computer remains untouched if you do not install JonDoFox
to the same directory and update an existing installation thereby. While
updating from earlier JonDoFox versions your bookmarks are kept. JonDoFox
"portable" is compatible with the <a
href="http://portableapps.com/">PortableApps</a> menu for which a lot of <a
href="http://portableapps.com/apps">other applications are available</a> as
well.</p>

<h3>Portable installation for Mac OS X (10.4 or higher)</h3>

<p>You get a "portable" version of JonDoFox for Mac OS X <!-- TODO -->
<a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_portable.dmg">here</a>
(or, as an alternative, the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/downloads/JonDoFox_OS_X_lite_portable.dmg">lite
version</a>). You may start this version from both a removable drive and from
your hard drive. For installation, please open the downloaded file with a
double click. Then copy the included file on a data medium of your choice. You
may start it from there with a simple double click. </p>

<h3><a name="critical_addons">Security relevant Firefox extensions</a></h3>

<p>The JonDoFox lite packet already contains all extensions which are relevant
for your security with optimised settings. You will find some other useful
extensions in the "complete packet which we have individually tested concerning
their security and compatibility with JonDoFox. The Firefox statur bar always
gives you control of the most important functions integrated in JonDoFox: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img alt="Statuszeile JonDoFox (CSLite, NoScript, AdblockPlus, JonDoFox)"
src="img_jondofox/jondofox_statusbar.png"></div>

<h3>Control Cookies with CS-Lite </h3>

<p>Using CS-Lite, you may very conveniently determine from which web sites you
accept Cookies and for which ones you block Cookies. If you click on the
CS-Lite Icon <span class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/cslite.gif"
alt="CS-Lite Icon"></span> with your left mouse button, you may give the
following approvals for the currently visited web site: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img src="img_jondofox/cslite_menu.gif" alt="CS-Lite Men&uuml;"> </div>
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_temp.gif)"><b>Allow
    temporarily</b><br>
    The Cookie is only accepted for the current browser session and will be
    removed afterwards. After browser restart, the web site is no more allowed
    to read or set a Cookie. <strong>This is the recommended setting for
    activating Cookies.</strong></li>
  <li style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_session.gif)"><b>Allow
    for session</b><br>
    The Cookie is only accepted for the current browser session and will be
    removed afterwards. After browser restart, the web site may set a new
    Cookie.</li>
  <li
    style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_allow.gif)"><b>Allow</b><br>
    The Cookie is stored in the browser as long as the web site allows. It may
    be kept and requested by the web site even after browser restart. </li>
  <li
    style="list-style-image:url(img_jondofox/cslite_remove.gif)"><b>Remove</b><br>
    An approval you have set before is removed. The web site is no more allowed
    to read or set a Cookie.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should never use the option <span
class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/cslite_global.gif"
alt="CS-Lite: Cookies global akzeptieren"> <b>Allow Cookies Globally</b></span>
if possible. This allows Cookies from all websites that have not been
explicitely <span class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/cslite.gif"
alt="CS-Lite: Cookies global akzeptieren"> <b>blocked</b></span>, and others
may follow your steps on the web.</p>

<h3>Filter advertisements with AdblockPlus</h3>

<p>AdblockPlus <img alt="AdblockPlus" src="img_jondofox/abp-enabled-16.png"
width="16"> works as an advertisement filter in the background. Typically, you
do not have to alter its settings. However, you may add your own filter lists
at any time.</p>

<h3>Control active contents with NoScript</h3>

<p>NoScript <img src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif" alt="NoScript-Icon"> lets you
conveniently control which potential dangerous scripts and plugins from a
webite your browser may execute and which not.</p>

<p><b>Controlling installed plugins</b><br>
When you visit a web site containing plugin content like Flash movies or Java
applets, these contents will be automatically blocked by NoScript. A
placeholder (left image) appears instead of the active content: </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-right:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_placeholder.gif" alt="NoScript-Platzhalter">
        </span> </td>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_blocked.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Geblockte Objekte Men&uuml;"> </span> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You may allow the content by clicking on the placeholder or by choosing the
respective option in <span><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_blockedcontent.gif"
alt="NoScript: Geblockte Objekte"> <b>Blocked Objects</b></span> after clicking
on the NoScript menu icon <img src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif"
alt="NoScript-Icon">. </p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Without <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/en/jondofox/faq#12n1327">special means of
protection</a>, allowed plugin contents may completely or partially revoke your
anonymity or even damage your system.</p>

<h4>Controlling JavaScript</h4>

<p>If you click on the NoScript icon<span class="nowrap"><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript.gif" alt="NoScript-Icon"></span> you get a list of
all addresses/service providers with JavaScript codes on the currently visited
web site. The respective entries are marked with the<span class="nowrap"><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript_temp.gif"
alt="NoScript tempor&auml;r erlauben"></span> icon: </p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-right:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_allow.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Erlaubnis erteilen"> </span> </td>
      <td><span style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;"><img
        src="img_jondofox/noscript_disallow.gif"
        alt="NoScript: Erlaubnis entziehen"> </span> </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>By clicking on <span><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_temp.gif"
alt="NoScript tempor&auml;r erlauben"> <b>Temporarily allow</b></span> you
activate scripts for this entry. By another click, as shown in the right image,
you may easily remove this permission again. If you would like to remove the
permission for all addresses, you just have to click on <span><img
src="img_jondofox/noscript_disallowall.gif"
alt="NoScript: Tempor&auml;re Berechtigungen aufheben"> <b>Revoke temporary
permissions</b></span>.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You should give as few of such permissions as
possible, and if possible only for the currently visited web site. Third-party
scripts or scripts from other addresses are often only used to spy on you, and
are rarely needed for the functionality of the web site.</p>

<p>If you generally distrust any address you may classify it as
<em>untrusted</em>, and it will afterwards no more show up within the addresses
you might allow. In order to make this classification, move your mouse over the
option <span class="nowrap"><img src="img_jondofox/noscript_untrwicon.gif"
alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig"> <b>Untrusted</b>.</span> Then, you
get an overview of the addresses on the visited web site which you may mark as
untrusted: </p>

<div style="text-align:left">
<img src="img_jondofox/noscript_untrustw.gif"
alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig Men&uuml;"> </div>

<p>You may undo this action the same way. </p>

<h3>Switching proxies</h3>

<p>If you would like to surf the Web with another (local) proxy than JonDo or
without any proxy, just use the button <img alt="JonDo-Proxy"
src="img_jondofox/jondofox_jondo.png"> integrated in JonDoFox (down to the
right) in order to switch between different proxy configurations: </p>

<p><img alt="JonDoFox-Popup" src="img_jondofox/jondofox_popup.png"></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>No Proxy</b>: If no proxy is set, JonDoFox directly connects to the
    Internet. <strong>Attention: Your IP address will thereby sent in plain and
    is not cloaked!</strong></li>
  <li><b>Custom</b>: Using this setting, you may activate your own proxy
    configuration. Choose <span class="nowrap"><img
    src="img_jondofox/servermanuell.gif"
    alt="NoScript: nicht vertrauensw&uuml;rdig"> <b>Edit Custom
    Proxy</b></span> in order to create such an individual proxy configuration.
    However, this is only recommended for experts.</li>
  <li><b>Tor</b>: If you have installed and started the program <a
    href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> you may use it as an alternative
    to JonDo by using this setting.</li>
  <li><b>JonDo</b>: When this setting is active, JonDoFox sends the browser's
    communication data over JonDo. JonDo needs to be separately <a
    href="https://www.jondos.de/en/download">installed and started</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever you like to bypass the proxy when downloading a file whithout
completely deactivating it (e.g. when downloading large files to save time and
money), just open the context menu with a right mouse click on the file and
choose <em>Bypass JonDo/Tor/Proxy and Save Link As...</em></p>

<h3>Downloading videos</h3>

<p>In order to keep yourself from having to activate the dangerous Flash in
your browser, you should always download web videos to your hard drive and play
them from there. This also saves you the additional data traffic which would be
needed to view a streaming video again. JonDoFox contains some download tools
for doing this. For Windows and Linux (under WINE), there moreover exists an
excellent freeware program called <a
href="http://atube-catcher.dsnetwb.com">aTube Catcher</a>. You may configure
this program for JonDo by activating the HTTP proxy in aTube Catcher under
<strong><em>Tools-&gt;Connection settings</em></strong> and setting it to
<strong><em>Host:127.0.0.1</em></strong> and <strong><em>Port:
4001</em></strong></p>

<p><img alt="aTube Catcher Connection settings: HTTP proxy 127.0.0.1:4001"
src="img_jondofox/aTubeCatcherConnection.png" width="338"></p>

<p>For playing movies of all video formats and on all operating systems, the
free <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN Media Player</a> is a very
good choice.</p>
