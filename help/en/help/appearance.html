<h2>Changing appearance</h2>

<p><em class="jconf">To get to this panel, press the button <code
class="jconf">Settings</code> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry
<code class="jconf">User Interface</code> from the list to the left.</em></p>

<p>In this dialog you can make changes to the appearance, language and message
display of JonDo.</p>

<h3>Appearance</h3>

<p>JonDo supports different themes for windows and elements. </p>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Language</b><br>
    Here you can change the language in which elements, dialogs and menus
    appear.<br>
    A restart of JonDo is needed for changes to take effect. You will be asked
    to do so. </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Look&amp;Feel</b><br>
    <i>Look&amp;Feel</i> determines the overall graphical appearance of the
    program. This includes the appearance of buttons, windows, text fields and
    other graphical elements. Look&amp;Feel depends on the OS you use. With
    this list you are given the option of customizing JonDo to your desire.
    Plus, you can add new Look&amp;Feel themes by downloading them from the
    Internet and importing them in JonDo. They are not JonDo-specific, i.e. you
    may theoretically use any theme compatible with Java Swing. Please remember
    that some of JonDo's elements may not be compatible with a given
    <em>Look&amp;Feel. You can revert settings anytime though if you encounter
    problems.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Import</b><br>
        New Look&amp;Feels may be found on <a
        href="http://www.javootoo.com">www.javootoo.com</a> e.g. Just download
        the themes you want and click <i>Import</i> afterwards. A file browser
        will open. Navigate to the location of the newly downloaded
        Look&amp;Feel package and choose the <i>.jar</i> file. An alert message
        will inform you whether the result was a success. If it was, you may
        now select the new theme from the list.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><b>Delete</b><br>
        This will delete the selected Look&amp;Feel. You can only delete those
        you added yourself.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Font size</b><br>
    Here you can change the font size of the user interface elements.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="expertView"></a>Display mode of JonDo</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Extended View</b><br>
    Extended View shows all options. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Simplified View</b><br>
    Simplified View will not show some advanced options that may be confusing
    for unexperienced users. The basic functionality of the program does not
    change thereby. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Mini View always on top </b><br>
    Fixates the JonDo <a href="miniwindow.html">Mini View</a> on top of all
    other windows. If unchecked, the <a href="miniwindow.html">Mini View</a>
    will be hidden behind other active windows. 
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Ignore DLL update warnings</b><br>
    If activated, no warning will be given when a more recent DLL version is
    available.<br>
    The DLL is a library of functions in the Windows environment for visual
    improvement and more convenient operation.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="afterStart"></a>Program startup</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>After starting JonDo...</b><br>
    If you activate this option, you will be given two further possible
    options: 
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>...show the Mini View</b><br>
        This option will show Mini View immediately after starting. 
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li><b>...to the Systray</b><br>
        If this option is selected, JonDo minimizes to the Windows systray
        immediately after starting. <em>This function is not available on all
        OS and requires an operating system specific DLL.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Splash screen toggle</b><br>
    If you don't want to see the splash screen when starting and quitting the
    program you can deactivate this option. Reactivate to see the screen
    again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Start browser when connecting (only JonDo Portable)</b><br>
    If you have started JonDo Portable with the commandline option
    <code>--portable &lt;Path to browser&gt;</code> and the given browser has
    been found, it will automatically be started when this option is activated.
    However, your browser will not start until you have established a
    connection to an anonymization service. If you prefer the browser to not
    start automatically, deactivate this option. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Path to Help</h3>

<p>For optimal accessibility your default browser will be used for displaying
the help pages. This requires the help files to be saved somewhere on your
harddisk or another media. The setting allows changing the path to these
files.</p>

<p>If you click the panel <code class="jconf">Move</code> a dialog will open
which allows you to set the path to the help pages. <em>Notice: With JonDo
Portable and on some OS this path can not be changed.</em></p>

<h3>Path to web browser</h3>

<p>JonDo-Portable automatically looks for a portable JonDoFox or Firefox. It is
referenced by JonDo-Portable to open web links and help files. If you would
like to configure the path to the (portable) browser yourself, you may do this
here. Just choose a browser executable file like iexplore.exe, opera.exe or
firefox.exe from a local drive (Windows examples). <em>Notice: The chosen
browser is NOT automatically configured for the usage of JonDo thereby. If you
do not use <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>, you have to configure the
browser yourself.</em></p>

<p>The path is always stored relative to the execution directory of
JonDo-Portable. It is thereby also valid on alien computer systems if the
browser is located on the same portable device as JonDo-Portable (e.g. a USB
flash drive).</p>

<h3>Remember location</h3>
<i>This option is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert
View</a>.</i> 

<p>If you check one of the following boxes the corresponding JonDo window will
reappear at the position where it was when you closed JonDo. This applies to
the following windows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Main View </li>
  <li>Settings</li>
  <li>Mini View</li>
</ul>

<h3>Remember size</h3>
<i>This option is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert
View</a>.</i> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Settings window</b><br>
    Checking this box will make JonDo remember the size of the settings window.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Program shutdown</h3>
<i>This option is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Expert
View</a>.</i> 
<ul>
  <li><b>Show warning when closing JonDo</b><br>
    When checked, JonDo displays a warning when closing the program which tells
    you to reconfigure your browser's proxy settings in order to continue
    surfing the web. </li>
</ul>
