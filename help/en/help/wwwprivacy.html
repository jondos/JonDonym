<h2>The World Wide Web and your privacy</h2>

<p>For sure, you can no longer imagine day-to-day life without the World Wide
Web. Those numerous services such as online banking, travel information,
encyclopedias or the like mean a great convenience in solving your common
tasks. Furthermore, you probably surf entertainment and shopping portals, stay
in touch with friends over social networks or share your common interests with
others in forums. To access the Web you are offered a dozen of stable, highly
functional yet easy to use applications, the browsers. The most popular
browsers are the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari and Google
Chrome.</p>
<!--<div class="topdown_navi">
<a href="#doctop"> Beginn &uarr; </a><a href="#docbottom"> &darr; Ende </a>
</div>-->

<p>Any communication on the Internet leaves all kinds of digital traces which
can be automatically acquired, saved and analyzed. Some companies have thus
specialized in creating individual user profiles from surfing related data.
These databases are of high economic value since they allow an enterprise to
comprehensively profile their costumers, that means you. This process is called
<a href="http://www.schober.de/site/index.php?id=137">data accumulation</a> in
data mining lingo.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why one should avoid leaving digital traces when
surfing: part of the data collected advects into scoring systems which are used
to evaluate loan requests, to create individually priced offers or to decide on
eligibility for C.O.D. service. Employers may be generated a character profile
of their job applicants from traces on the Net prior to hiring them. Freedom of
opinion is limited by governments or institutions where they trace individual
surfers that use or edit certain web services or deny them any usage at all.
Companies may recognize employees of other businesses or even those of their
competition and subsequently annoy them with promotional calls or email spam.
Browser related data exposes vulnerabilities in the surfing machine which may
allow for a subsequent direct attack on it.</p>

<p>Further problematic is that these traces <b>are collected, saved, sent and
processed without your consent and most widely unnoticed.</b> The actual
techniques employed by the data miners on the Web are briefly introduced
below.</p>
<!--<div class="topdown_navi">

<h3>Active Web content</h3>

<p>Webcontent accessible by browser plugins such as Flash, Java, ActiveX and
Silverlight renders the Web more dynamic and colorful but also more dangerous,
for they allow websites to execute code on your PC. By certain manipulations
these plugins can read and edit files on your machine and in an extreme case
even gain complete control over it. Especially beware signed Java applets: by
accepting its signature the applet and thereby the visited webserver
automatically receive all user rights on your machine. It does not help to only
surf websites you deem trustworthy either. This concept is outdated since
nowadays even numerous large and notorious websites are being hacked and filled
with malicious code. The browser scripting language JavaScript is better
protected against attacks on your privacy than the aforementioned plugins but
not completely safe. Therefore we recommend you turn on JavaScript only as
needed and switch it off otherwise. </p>

<p>You should not surf the Internet without a well secured browser, as your PC
is otherwise in danger of being attacked quite soon. Instead of configuring the
browser yourself, which takes quite some experience, you may use for example <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> for free. This Mozilla Firefox based browser
does not only block all active content at default (you can turn this back on if
needed) it is also equipped with further ample security mechanisms. Most
websites will still be reachable. YouTube videos and videos of other such
portals which are rendered by Flash may be downloaded with special software and
then viewed safely with a video player. Websites which demand usage of active
plugins should be avoided if possible.</p>

<h3><a name="cookies">Cookies</a></h3>

<p>Without cookies, certain services would be complicated to realize in a
webserver. If a user requests a page from a webserver, it can not readily match
requests of previous pages requested from this server to that same user.
Nevertheless, some services require a sort of memory. Shopping portals are an
example: a server has to remember what goods were placed into the virtual
shopping cart. This "memory" is usually written into cookies, i.e. small text
files which are being sent to you by the server upon every page request. When
your browser contacts the server again, it also automatically sends back the
cookie stored earlier. The server thereby allocates the right shopping cart to
you.</p>

<p>But cookies can also be abused to track your steps on the Internet. This
works exceptionally well with web portals (e.g. Yahoo) and search engines (e.g.
Google) for you use these a lot in order to reach other websites. With cookies,
a web host can record large parts of your surfing behavior over years and
easily relate it to you as a person with your "accumulated" profile data. Most
internet users have collected hundreds of cookies from various websites on
their PC without their knowledge. You should thus, in any case and at the
latest, delete cookies after your browser session. Modern browsers usually
integrate an optional function for this, but it has to be activated by the user
first. In <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> it has been made default.</p>

<h3>Browser Header</h3>

<p>With every request for a webpage, browsers send information within the
framework of the HTTP protocol that can be analyzed by the visited site:
language, browser name and version, operating system and version, supported
charsets, files, codecs and the last visited webpage. Sending these headers is
usually not necessary for rendering websites, but it can be exploited for
reidentifying, profiling and analyzing websurfers.</p>

<p>As of today, different filter applications and services have been developed
that allow hiding or changing problematic browser headers (e.g. Privoxy,
Proxomitron). Unfortunately, these applications can not filter encrypted
connections: once you load a presumably "secure" website (HTTPS, browser lock)
all filtering fails. Plus, these programs allow every user to define the header
data himself. But setting an individual browser type e.g. is in itself what
renders you quasi perfectly trackable. Therefore, in <a
href="about.html">JonDo</a>, an automatic filtering has been integrated which
allocates an uniform header profile at least for unencrypted connections
(HTTP). Those who want to achieve an even higher level of security should rely
on <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> though. It always sends the same
profile for encrypted connections too. This guarantees that websites may at
maximum realize that it is a JonDo user visiting, but not who.</p>

<h3>Browser History</h3>

<p>By certain trickery, websites can tell which other websites are saved in
your browser history. For this, the visited website embeds special formatting
commands (CSS, Stylesheets) that contain external links "of interest" on the
pages you visit. If you have visited one of the external websites, your browser
will react by executing a command defined in the format, e.g. download a small
picture form the website. The website can thereby completely or largely guess
the contents of your browser history.</p>

<p>At the moment, there is no reliable protection against this technique apart
from deactivating the browser history, which has been made default in <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>.</p>

<h3>Browser Cache</h3>

<p>From the contents of your browser cache one can conclude on previously
visited, thus already cached, websites: the time required for loading a website
changes when part of it is already in the browser cache. By subtle placement of
the images on the website, which are loaded one by one, the server can analyze
the cache one by one.</p>

<p>Unlike deactivating your browser history, deactivating your cache would have
tremendous effect on your surfing speed, which is why we don't recommend it. In
<a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> a protective mechanism has been integrated
instead which bypasses cache for third party content. Also, the cache is
deleted automatically when you close the browser. A website can thus no longer
gain information about other websites, only about itself.</p>

<h3>Webbugs and Banner Ads</h3>

<p>Very likely, you will find one or more <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> in
your browser from data miners such as <a
href="http://www2.infonline.de/">ivwbox.de (INFONLINE)</a>, <a
href="http://www.doubleclick.com/">doubleclick.net</a>, <a
href="http://www.advertisement.com/">advertisement.com</a> or <a
href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, although you have never even visited
their websites. This is due to the fact that these enterprises use, on other
web sites, a simple trick to nevertheless plant cookies on you and watch your
browsing: <em>Webbugs</em>.</p>

<p>"Webbugs" are usually pictures of 1x1 pixels and therefore invisible to the
viewer. However, they can also be coded into banner ads embedded in a website.
The website contains a picture (webbug) that is loaded from another server
running a statistics service (such as Doubleclick, Google Analytics). Thereby
the statistics service may set or edit a cookie in your browser unnoticeably.
The browser will then send this cookie back to the statistics service with
every new request for a site where any webbug of this service is embedded. If
the service is used on many different websites, it can now track large parts of
your browsing session. If the owner of the statistics service moreover
collaborates with the owner of your preferred search engine, he gets an almost
complete picture of your internet activities.</p>

<p>The privacy functions of most current browsers that either flatly deny
cookies or only deny third party cookies, and alternatively also delete all
cookie data when closing the browser, do not achieve optimal protection. To
prevent session tracking, all cookies should be blocked by default if possible
and only allowed in if needed for the duration of the session. <a
href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> is therefore preconfigured to deny all
cookies but allow single websites at the expense of two mouse clicks. We
recommend allowing cookies only on a temporary basis, so that they will be
automatically blocked again after the session.</p>

<p>Another nasty feature of webbugs is, that they send, besides cookies, also
your <a href="#ip">IP address</a> to the statistics service upon request. Even
with a very good browser configuration, by switching off cookies and by using
webbug filters, you are never able to reliably prevent this. The only effective
protection against this are anonymisation services like <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="ip" id="ip">IP address</a></h3>

<p>The IP address is given to you by your provider on dialing into the
Internet, and it is then saved for months or even years together with your
customer data and your online time. It is your distinct identifier on the
Internet which is sent along whenever you make a direct connection to any
internet service. This address tells the server where to send his response. As
long as your IP does not change, it is easy to monitor when and what website
you have contacted. The IP also reveals your provider, many times your location
and, in case of a company or computer center, usually what terminal you are on.
In many cases, an IP address relates directly to one person. </p>

<p>Some of the information that is given away by your IP or browser can be
reviewed on the <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/anontest">JonDos test
page</a>.</p>

<p>While the traces mentioned so far can be blurred without any special
services needed, the same can not be said about your IP address. That is why
the software <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> has been developed: In order to
blur any connection between your IP and the websites you visit, <a
href="about.html">JonDo</a> connects to the service <a
href="jondonym.html">JonDonym</a>. This service then interlaces the servers of
different organizations with your PC and the Internet. You are now surfing with
the IP of the respectively last server within a chain/cascade of a few
so-called mix servers. The data sent by you is separately encrypted for every
mix server and slightly altered in size and sequence so that nobody can
eavesdrop on or guess your data stream. You are therewith protected even for
the case that some (but not all) operators get hacked, bribed threatened or
otherwise forced to observe your access.</p>
