<H2>Update Java Software (JRE) </H2>

JonDo is written in the Java Programming language and therefore needs an installed <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> for execution. Installing Java, however, leads to the integration of a so-called plugin in your web browser that enables this browser to execute Java web applications (applets). Unfortunately in this plugin, as in each software, quite often errors are found, from which some may compromise the security of the computer where it is installed. JonDo therefore indicates updates for your Java, and we strongly recommend to do such an update as soon as possible. Moreover, you should always <a href="noactive.html">deactivate the plugin in your browser</a>, as its execution may lead to a deanonymisation of your internet connection, despite an active JonDo.
<P>Although Java supports contemporary installations of different versions, you should furthermore have only <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102557-1">ONE Java version installed on your computer</a>. Therefore uninstall all old versions of this software before performing the new Java installation.
<P>In order to update your Java installation, follow these three steps:
<OL>
	<LI><b>Download current version</b><br>
	Get the current version from <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">this site</a> (please note that Sun-Java versions since 1.4 do not run on Windows 95). Look for "Java Runtime Environment (JRE) &lt;version number&gt;". Press "Download". On the follwing site, check "Accept License Agreement". After that, click the link "Windows Offline Installation, Multi-language". ("Online Installation" also works fine in case you are online during installation process since the installer will have to load data from the internet).
	<P>
	<LI><b>Uninstall old version</b><br>
	Go to start menu, open "system control" and choose "Software". It might take a while until the list of installed software shows up. Choose the entry "J2SE Runtime Environment &lt;version number&gt;" and click "uninstall". Wait for the uninstaller to complete. Perhaps you will have to restart your PC.
	<P>
	<LI><b>Install new Version</b><br>
	Double-click the installer you downloaded in step 1). Follow installation instructions. Installation might take quite some time. Perhaps you will have to restart your PC.
