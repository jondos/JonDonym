<H2>Payment: Advanced Settings</H2>
<i>This panel is only available in <a href="appearance.html#expertView">Extended View</a>.</i>
<P>
To get to this panel, press button <i>Settings</i> in JonDo's main window, then choose the entry <i>Payment</i> from the list to the left, then open the tab <i>Advanced Settings</i>. In this dialog you may specify advanced settings for payment.
<P>
<UL><!--
    <LI><B>Show confirm dialog before using a service with costs</B><BR>
    Activating this option will cause JonDo to display a confirmation dialog each time a service with costs is about to be used. This also means that JonDo will not be able to connect to a service with costs automatically during startup.
    <P>-->
    <LI><B>Allow non-anonymous connections to payment instances</B><BR>
    If activated, JonDo can get information about your account balance even if you have no anonymized connection currently established.<br>
    If this option is deactivated, account information may be gathered through anonymized connections only.<br>
    Thus, it is recommended to activate this option.
    <P><LI><B>Show error messages from accounting instance (Only available in development version)</B><BR>
    If activated, error messages concerning the accounting instance will be shown. It is recommended to do so.<br>
    <br>In stable versions, this is always activated.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Automatically update account balance</B><BR>
    If activated, JonDo will try to update your account balance at fixed intervals.<br>
    If you do not allow this, JonDo will not automatically show your current account balance. Your account will still be managed correctly by the payment instance, anyway.
    <P>
  <LI><B>Warn when closing JonDo and not all accounts are backed up </B><BR>
    You may choose JonDo to warn you if one or more of your accounts have not been backed up and JonDo is being closed. Remember that if your JonDo configuration is damaged or lost, and you do not have backups of your accounts, there is no way to get your money back.
     <P>
  <LI><B>Connect timeout</B><BR>
    Sets the timeout for connections to the payment instance. If you have problems in creating or charging accounts, increasing this timeout may solve them.
