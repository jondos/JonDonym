<h2>JonDonym, AN.ON and Tor</h2>

<p>The anonymization service JonDonym, a technical branch from the <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">AN.ON Project</a>, consists of multiple
user selectable mix cascades. A cascade itself consists of three mix servers
operated by independent and non interrelated organizations or private
individuals who all <a href="certificates.html">publish their identity</a>. The
operators have to abide by strict provisions which prohibit saving connection
data or exchanging such data with other operators in a cascade. Every
connection from a user is re-encrypted by every mix server within a cascade and
transferred through the cascade to the target, e.g. a website. The aim of
multiple encryption, distribution and processing is to make sure no mix
operator can by himself alone expose the user, and that eavesdropping on the
connection (Internet provider, WLAN) produces zero useful content. Also, since
a lot of users surf the anonymization service simultaneously, and thus share
the same <a href="wwwprivacy.html#ip">IP address</a>, all connections of every
user are concealed amidst each other: any user could have been the source of a
certain connection. This procedure ensures that no mix operator or external
party (Internet provider, WLAN sniffers, websites) can discover who has
initiated a certain connection or what connections a certain user has made.</p>

<p>JonDonym has some very specific advantages to other anonymization
services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Strong encryption and authentication:</b> Nobody can read the traffic
    between your PC and the JonDonym service. (Encrypted with RSA 2048 and AES
    128; signed with DSA, RSA or ECDSA; realized with the BouncyCaslte and
    OpenSSL libraries)</li>
  <li><b>Protection from the mix operator:</b> Unless all mix operators in a
    JonDonym cascade are forced separately to monitor you, your internet
    connections are safe. The mix operators are revaluated regularly concerning
    seriosity and professionalism. Their identity is made public also. Even in
    the highly improbable case that they all are forced to unmask a certain
    connection, this function would have to be compiled into each server
    software first.</li>
  <li><b>No logfiles:</b> Saving any logfiles with IP addresses, even for
    seconds, is forbidden to the mix operators by contract. The same holds true
    for the actual contents of the data. Exceptions caused by national laws are
    marked clearly.</li>
  <li><b>Transparent functionality:</b> Informative GUI, published concepts,
    open/OSI compliant sourcecode of all software components.</li>
  <li><b>No software backdoor:</b> There is no possibility to inspect single
    connections in the <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> client. The software runs
    completely on your PC and can not be manipulated without your approval. No
    identity, serial number or account number is transmitted during update to
    exclude any directed update manipulations by the developer himself. Updates
    may be done entirely through an anonymized connection.</li>
  <li><b>Secure browser profile:</b> With <a href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a>
    you are given a Firefox profile for free which has been especially
    developed for anonymous and secure surfing with JonDonym.</li>
  <li><b>Portable anonymity:</b> <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> runs without
    installation on the PC directly from a portable USB stick (Windows / Mac OS
    X).</li>
  <li><b>Evolution by research:</b> Scientific work conducted at the Technical
    University of Dresden (AN.ON), the University of Regensburg (AN.ON) and at
    the JonDos GmbH (JonDonym) enhances and improves the system.</li>
  <li><b>Competent, fast and at no charge:</b> Detailed help, monitored user
    forum, email support.</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar standard of anonymization can only be offered by the
non-commercial system <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>, which we recommend
to advanced Internet users in addition to JonDonym. Internet beginners and
computer novices should be careful with Tor: there is no control over who runs
the servers in this service over which your data travels. In the past, there
has been ongoing suspicion that criminals and intelligence agencies exploit the
Tor network in order to secretly attain unencrypted information like passwords,
bank accounts and credit cards. Certain tricks can enable the Tor server to
concentrate much of the traffic on itself, making the exploit even more
effective. Tor may be set as <a href="net.html">proxy in JonDo</a> though,
making surfing slower but, in some cases, even more secure than with JonDonym
alone because the last servers in this chain will be part of the verified
JonDonym network.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, every last mix server in a JonDonym cascade could
record data which is not separately secured by HTTPS/SSL. Unlike Tor and other
services, in JonDonym only seriosity certified and publicized persons and
organizations may operate a mix server. The user may then decide for himself on
whether he trusts the operator or not. All this makes it highly improbable for
criminal operators to infiltrate JonDonym and go about unpunished.</p>

<h3><a name="premium" id="premium">Premium services</a></h3>

<p>With JonDonym you can choose between free services and the chargeable
premium services. To pay for premium services you need an account. <b>By this
voluntary prepaid payment for premium services you support the continuation of
the JonDonym system and the improvement of the JonDo software</b>. Using
premium services offers these additional advantages to the basic features of
JonDo:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Guaranteed access</b>: A connection to at least one of the premium
    services is guaranteed for a minimum of 90% of the annual average.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed performance:</b> Within the framework of the above
    guaranteed access, at least one service with a speed of at least 100 kbit/s
    and latencies of 4 seconds maximum will be available during 90% of the
    daily average. Free services, also Tor, are usually much slower.</li>
  <li><b>Legal certainty:</b> Development, support and billing addresses are
    all located in Germany and not at some anonymous offshore company without a
    summonable address. Germany sets worldwide standards in customer
  protection.</li>
  <li><b>Three-Operator-Guarantee:</b> Every premium mix cascade is run by
    three organizations or individuals that are independent from each
  other.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed internationality:</b> Mixes and operators of a premium
    cascade are spread over at least two countries. This ensures that no large
    network node (CIX) can monitor all data traffic. And it cripples every
    national data retention since a situation where all mixes in a cascade do
    log never occurs.</li>
  <li><b>Guaranteed connection:</b> The mix operators generally do not block
    any Internet ports (except email ports, if needed for spam defense).</li>
</ul>

<p>Excluded from these guarantees are software errors that we discharge from
liability in our <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/de/termsAndConditions">GTCT</a>. Further possible
exclusions concerning the performance of a single service may be found in the
GTCTs of the respective mix operators.</p>

<p>If you would like to use premium services, create a <a
href="payment.html">disposable account</a> and activate it by an anonymous or
non anonymous <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">payment of your
choice</a>. After that you will have a certain amount of data volume at your
disposal, <a href="https://www.jondos.de/en/payment">depending on your chosen
rate,</a> to pay for premium services. Once it is depleted, you can create and
activate another disposable account any time.</p>

<p>Advice on protection of personal information: for accurate clearing of data
volumes with the mix operators it is saved how much volume an account has used
cumulatively on a mix cascade. These clearings happen no sooner than on a daily
basis. An allocation of accounts to user identities is not saved. It is
technically impossible to recognize requested websites by the deducted data
volumes alone, even when monitoring accurately to the second or at maximum
accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Notice: The premium services are not available in all versions of
the program. You can download compatible software at the <a
href="https://www.jondos.de/">JonDos website</a>. If you are a Java programmer,
you may moreover compile and modify the software, and specifically activate
those features which are useful for you (<a
href="https://svn.jondos.de/">SVN-Repository</a> or <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_en.html">CVS-Repository</a>).</strong></p>
