<h2>JonDonym, AN.ON and Tor</h2>

<p><strong>The JonDonym/AN.ON technology is based on the principle of multiple
encryption, distribution and processing. This procedure does not only protect
your internet activities from being observed by third parties (<em>against your
access provider, WLAN hackers, advertising services and websites</em>), but
also against observation by the individual JonDonym providers themselves
(<em>against JonDonym service operators and their billing
providers</em>).</strong></p>

<p>The anonymization service JonDonym is a development branch of the <a
href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de">AN.ON Project</a>. It consists of multiple
user selectable mix cascades. A cascade consists of two or three mix servers
operated by independent and non interrelated organizations or private
individuals who all <a href="certificates.html">publish their identity</a>. The
operators have to abide by strict provisions which prohibit saving connection
data or exchanging such data with other operators in a cascade. Every
connection from a user is differently encrypted for every mix server within a
cascade and transferred through the cascade to the target, e.g. a website.
Thereby no mix operator alone can by himself expose the user. Eavesdroppers on
the connections to JonDonym mixes get garbage data only. Also, since a lot of
users surf the anonymization service simultaneously, and thus share the same <a
href="wwwprivacy.html#ip">IP address</a>, all connections of every user are
concealed amidst each other: a correlation is not possible any more. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img alt="JonDonym" src="jondonym.jpg"
width="515"></p>

<p>JonDonym has many advantages to other anonymization services:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Protection against your own internet access provider:</b> Strong
    encryption and authentication protect you from being observed. Nobody can
    read the traffic between your PC and the JonDonym service. (Encrypted with
    RSA 1024 and AES 128; signed with DSA, RSA or ECDSA; realized with the
    BouncyCastle and OpenSSL libraries)</li>
  <li><b>Protection against the anonymity service operators:</b> Unless all mix
    operators in a JonDonym cascade are separately forced by a court order,
    blackmail or a hacker attack to monitor you, your JonDonym connections are
    safe. The mix operators are revaluated regularly concerning seriosity and
    professionalism. Their identity is made public also. Even in the highly
    improbable case that they all are forced to unmask a certain connection,
    this function would have to be compiled into each server software
  first.</li>
  <li><b>No logfiles:</b> Saving any logfiles with IP addresses is forbidden to
    the mix operators by contract. The same holds true for the actual contents
    of the data. Exceptions caused by national prescriptions are marked and
    described clearly.</li>
  <li><b>Transparent functionality:</b>The program user interface has an
    especially informative design. The source codes of all program components
    are published according to an <a href="http://www.jondos.de/en/licence">OSI
    compliant licence</a> (<a href="https://svn.jondos.de/">SVN-Repository</a>
    and <a
    href="http://anon.inf.tu-dresden.de/develop/sources_de.html">CVS-Repository</a>).</li>
  <li><b>No software backdoor:</b> There is no possibility to inspect single
    connections in the <a href="about.html">JonDo</a> client. The software runs
    completely on your PC and can not be manipulated without your approval. No
    identity, serial number or account number is transmitted during update to
    impede any directed update manipulations by hackers or the developers
    themselves. Updates may be done entirely through an anonymized
  connection.</li>
  <li><b>Secure browser profile:</b> With the <a
    href="jondofox.html">JonDoFox</a> you are given a Firefox profile for free
    which has been especially developed for anonymous and secure surfing with
    JonDonym.</li>
  <li><b>Portable anonymity:</b> <a href="../../de/help/about.html">JonDo</a>
    also runs without installation on the PC directly from a portable USB stick
    (Windows / Mac OS X).</li>
  <li><b>Easy combination with other products:</b> You may easily combine JonDo
    with other anonymization products, for example with Tor or <a
    href="otherServices.html">VPN services</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Evolution by research:</b> Scientific work conducted at the Technical
    University of Dresden (AN.ON), the University of Regensburg (AN.ON) and at
    the JonDos GmbH (JonDonym) enhances and constantly improves the system.</li>
  <li><b>Competent, fast and at no charge:</b> Very comprehensive help texts
    describe the application and its context detailed and understandably.
    Moreover, an administered user forum and e-mail support may be used for
    free.</li>
</ul>

<p>A similar anonymization can only be offered by the non-commercial software
<a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>. Internet beginners should be careful
with Tor, though: there is no control over who runs the servers in this service
over which your data travels. In the past, there has been ongoing suspicion
that criminals and intelligence agencies exploit the Tor network in order to
secretly attain unencrypted information like passwords, bank accounts and
credit cards. Certain tricks can enable the Tor server to concentrate much of
the traffic on itself, making the exploit even more effective. Tor may be set
as <a href="net.html">proxy in JonDo</a> though, making surfing considerably
slower but, in some individual cases, even more secure than with JonDonym alone
because the last servers in this chain will be part of the verified JonDonym
network.</p>

<p>Like in Tor, the respective last mix server in a JonDonym cascade could
record data which is not separately secured by HTTPS/SSL (has to be offered by
the web site itself). Unlike Tor and other services, however, in JonDonym only
certified and publicized persons and organizations may operate a mix server.
The user may then decide for himself on whether he trusts the operator or not.
If needed, they may simply choose other operators. All this makes it highly
improbable for criminal operators to infiltrate JonDonym.</p>
